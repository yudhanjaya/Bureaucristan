Can a machine model, working in combination with human curation and editing, become a fresh new voice in digital poetry? A software cyborg, relying on a symbiosis of human and automated action to create and spread content via social media: can it can appeal to real humans out there in the void? Can we, by doing this, break down the barrier between art and machine, and illustrate a future where we work together to make good art? 

OSUN is precisely that - her words and interactions are meant to be a showcase of the transhumanist (H+) worldview. The future will not be human vs AI, but human + AI. 

Along the way, OSUN is meant to serve a secondary purpose. Much (not all) poetry gaining popularity today, especially on social media, is simpler and smaller than the work of yore. Arguments about quality have persisted and will persist - from Pirsig's rambling Phaedrus to whoever occupies the Guardian soapbox this week. Machine learning allows us to deploy an more objective approach to defining the quality of a piece of poetry: how easy is it to generate? 

OSUN is an attempt to find out.

## STAGE ONE: THE FIRST FIFTY
1. Trained OSUN on pure Tang samples
2. Created Instagram account (@osunpoet)
3. Created Twitter account (@osunpoet), connect Insta to Twitter. 
4. Created fifty faces from the Karras et. al GAN (https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) for use in first fifty posts. 
5. Batch process faces in GIMP for filtered cartoon effect, upload.
6. Generate first fifty samples

## STAGE TWO: MIMIC BEHAVIOUR

1. Create IG bot that can follow poetry hashtags, people, and like content. Bot must perform only a few actions a day.
2. Create Twitter bot that can do the same as above.

## STAGE THREE: MIMIC BEHAVIOUR - II

1. Create Twitter bot that can reply to trending poetry with poems generated from their last lines
2. Replies to people should be human.

## STAGE FOUR: IN SEARCH OF UNIQUE VOICE

1. Expand and test with, Tang poetry and Rumi
