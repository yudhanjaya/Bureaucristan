Can a machine model, working in combination with human curation and editing, become a fresh new voice in digital poetry? Can it can appeal to real humans out there in the void? Can we, by doing this, break down this boring human vs AI narrative, and illustrate a future where we work together to make good art? 

OSUN is an attempt to find out, using [OpenAI GPT2-117m](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/)

## STAGE ONE: LEARNING THE TANG
1. Prepare training dataset of Tang poetry translations - done
2. Training OSUN v1 - done
3. Generate first 100 poems - done

## STAGE TWO: #AMWRITING - in progress

1. Curate and edit poems from the generated 100 to post online.
2. Curate and edit public domain artwork and faces from the Karras et. al GAN (https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) for use in posts.

## STAGE THREE:  IN SEARCH OF VOICE

1. Minimalism: Take OSUN beyond the Tang poetry to Rumi, William Carlos Williams, Robert Creele
2. Theater: Train OSUN on Shakespearean iambic pentameter 
3. Complexity and the grace of God: Explore possibilities of extending OSUN into Yeats-era English poetry, most of which contains heavy allusions to Christianity and thus jar in both language and themes with her existing view of the world.

For an explanation of how OSUN came to be, read my article [on Towards Data Science about training GPT-117 and the surprising clarity of human + machine Tang poetry](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-poetry-machine-2764ec8b340b)
Part of OSUN's interactions are handled by [Instaboy.py](https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py). 

Faces used on the Instagram posts are created from www.thispersondoesnotexist.com. For details on inner workings, follow up on [the StyleGAN work by Karras et al. and Nvidia](https://www.lyrn.ai/2018/12/26/a-style-based-generator-architecture-for-generative-adversarial-networks). 

Raw faces are run through GIMP 2.10, Alessandro Francesconi's [BIMP](https://alessandrofrancesconi.it/projects/bimp/) and the 'Conte' script from http://www.gimphelp.org/artist_conte.html
