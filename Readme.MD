Can a machine model, working in combination with human curation and editing, become a fresh new voice in digital poetry? Can it can appeal to real humans out there in the void? Can we, by doing this, break down the barrier between art and machine, and illustrate a future where we work together to make good art? 

OSUN is an attempt to find out. Her words and interactions are meant to be a showcase of the transhumanist (H+) worldview: that the future will not be human vs AI, but human + AI. 

Created, shaped and guided by @yudhanjaya.


## STAGE ONE: THE FIRST FIFTY
1. Trained OSUN on pure Tang samples
2. Created Instagram account (@osunpoet)
3. Created Twitter account (@osunpoet), connect Insta to Twitter. 
4. Created fifty faces from the Karras et. al GAN (https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) for use in first fifty posts. 
5. Batch process faces in GIMP for filtered cartoon effect, upload.
6. Generate first fifty samples

## STAGE TWO: MIMIC BEHAVIOUR

1. Create IG bot that can follow poetry hashtags, people, and like content. Bot must perform only a few actions a day.
2. Create Twitter bot that can do the same as above.

## STAGE THREE: MIMIC BEHAVIOUR - II

1. Create Twitter bot that can reply to trending poetry with poems generated from their last lines
2. Replies to people should be human.

## STAGE FOUR: IN SEARCH OF UNIQUE VOICE
