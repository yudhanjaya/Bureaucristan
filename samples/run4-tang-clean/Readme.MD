HI, MY NAME IS LAURA MENDO

I am a sick old lady in an oh-so-happy house.
There she is, a thousand miles from home,
Grasses return with a tinkling cask of wine.
I sit and think, Oh, this is the place where the great Musketeers were shot.
How may my blue cap and yellow silk play on the cold light of a thousand candles?
The moon is in my tree, watching for birds in the damp cloud.
I hear a bugle.

### Not entirely sure what happened. 
The supposedly clean rollback generates strange fruit on the samples generated during training. However, a second unconditional general call reveals better work around the 500-cycle model:

```
There are sojourns below the clouds:
And at sunset, by one that guards the river,
Drags its sides deep in the mist.
...It rains now on the rocks north of the Bridge of Fire.
Why do people come here who are fickle,
And never at ease with sun?....
High mountain, how can I help thinking of you?
New Year's resolution, old friend. We meet again.
What are you thinking of, old friend?
Spring will close in on your bank,
Replace old woods and old rushes with fresh sand.
Don't leave us like this, guard our fountain.
We have to hand pick flowers.
Willowing willows will no use cutting them,
So how can we bear to sweep the fields?
...Unhappy twins, unhappy pairs.
We are glad to be apart from the world.
But here you are, moving westward in a southward tide.
We shall both be shadowed by drift;
In your midget's leather chariot.
We shall both be watching the bright moon through our earthen windows.
We see late bloom violets starting white clumps,
And early autumn candles washing the lone dew.
There are no more dusty pollens today;
And far away a monk shall be calling away frost.
...It is very late in the spring,
And here in the darkness all winter long we meet.
We have ceased work on our summons together.
We have both been teaching here so long.
Why lecture together so long?..


A CONFESSION

With my wine-bottle, watching on the river,
My conscience has tipped me toward the presidential campaign.
Tonight in the deciding presidential election,
I shall be voting Democrat.
As President Obama is about to sign an executive
Contrary to every warning, I look toward the capital.
For a change in the wind, a change in the weather,
I hear a bell that breaks behind me on Lake Dongting.
I have a petition to present in the morning,
A change of cap for my tattered old jacket;
There are flowers and aress for my withered sleeve.
But this is the way it is, past midnight:
All else is with fate, not ours to control;
But we, president and legislator, assemble,
And think of the long road ahead,
As we sit and watch on the corner of two mountains.


A PARTING

There are many a season in Lake Dongting.
On a spring evening, taking into consideration weather,
Considerations which concern no one other than ourselves.
The great trees of this southern lake offer a canopy of shade,
While solitary palms of the southern mountains offer a gloom.
We both are workers in forestry, having little time for the passions of men.
I am a teacher in a southern town;
And so I listen to sopranos in the evening bell.
Do you doubt my sincerity?
To the moon you can see the long road ahead....
I have a petition to present in the morning,
A change of cap for my tattered old coat;
There are flowers and aress for my withered sleeve.
But this is the way it is, with what is known.
What is known, what is not known.


ONE-HEARTED

When those red berries come in springtime,
Like the first flush of the sun in the west,
And the evening cloud rises like a dawn in the east,
Spring mightily fed on these sweet little berries
Receptive us for my sake,
But refused our cup of wine.
Since life is a cup of gold,
What use is it to have too little?
Perhaps sing these farewells to fickle tastes?


ONE-SPREADING

When she was a child of the Yellow River,
She went to study at the Lake-Stokes School for Terrace-Wangctors.
When she was fifteen years old,
Her father, a district general,
Was killed in action.
You know how to care for an old tailor's knife.
You lack poison-pill-box-spirit to use in an aged vase?....
Spring would be vainly seeky,
Till wanderers pine their way through the long woods.

Yes, "One-spreading" is weird, and so are the "Terrace-Wangctors", but these are minor copyedits. As a bonus, I've cleaned the noisy bits out the of the dataset and now we have poetry without page numbers or annotations. Now we just have poetry, which is ideal. 

Let OSUN begin.
