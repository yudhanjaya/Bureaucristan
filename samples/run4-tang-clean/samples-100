A PASSENGER'S VIEW OF THE WINE HOUSE

A PASSENGER'S VIEW OF THE WINE HOUSE

From the Copper Pine House outspread in the sea the green-tip birds,
Flitting about the little boat, singing, dancing.
... At a little hook in the wall between the branches
And a green and white-edged door among the twigs,
Shall an emperor turn and see if he please?
... At the western end of the garden a mulberry-cone
Lines high above the green and white,
Toward the twilight palace-peak....
Though a wind of autumn chill these green branches, how shall I protect them?
...In the upper chambers the moon is blowing, toward the eastward....
Their turbans, their coats are wet,
Yet no one notices -- just us.


SEEING A DRINKER ABOUND

A DRINKER

Far behind us
In a little boat
Where is our lodging? --
We drink, we eat;
But no one notices.


A DWELLING MIDNIGHT

While we wait for a guest
To cross the harbour
He stops at a fishing-pool --
He lies down by the stream,
He leans in the water,
He leans forward a little,
He leans forward a little.
...We shall soon be together,
But heavens-faree: there's nobody here....
Our smiles and our parting-song fade.



IN THE FORTRESS

A PASSENGER

High above the waves
Here I go and admire
Virtually nothing --
The flag of China flies.
But I hear a Daoist priest warning
Me not to follow in the dust.


A MESSAGE TO CENSOR XUE

In haste I this day to Cui Fuzhou
Find your lost sister
Where she was found in the night
And is safe on the Xiuzhou highlands.
...I ask you what she has meant
To this world since she was little;
And you say: "A fairy crown."


IN HER FORTRESS

The girl who thought to be Queen Mogensha
Has conquered the world.
Her mind has reached the Celestial Kingdom....
The Jade Mirror shows clearly where she is headed....
But the Queen of Flower-Powers lives only in the Mirror of her Will.


A SONG OF SU WAN

My Mother-In-Law
Was the ruler of Yunnan very long ago
And she was still alive when she left China ?
Her eldest child was only thirteen;
And she still has not heard from him.
...Oh, when shall my turn come? when shall my kingdom come ?
Though a girl of twenty-five
Who dreams of dancing and singing,
Is now grown and very matriarchal.



A SONG OF A PAINTING TO A BUDDHIST MONK

The Jade Mirror is shining with her song.
The student, on her throne,
Has taken her daily jade mat
And is lifting up in her fingers the Jade Books.
The monk, taking out his staff,
Scours the bright blue sand.
He finds only flowers.
He picks out those he thinks are holy.



PARTING I

A CONFESSION

I

Have desired and desired for many years
That all my friends and neighbors
Had known each other as friends.
Living together, I have grown fond of reading,
Of drum and chariot, of cardamon, of stringed instruments.
I turn to my fellow men
And say to my song-players:
"Oh, when will we meet again, beyond the mountain ?
....Our paths may lead again into the sunset
With the high moon returning a misty cloud.


Parting II

THE YELLOW RIVER

You foretold it, and I am lying in a little boat
On the river that once held all the world
And bubbled toward heaven all night.
I am glad to be a part of it, to sail from river to river,
Yet I think of you less than in youfrancoo
The fisher-boat's bell sounds.


Parting III

A NIGHT ABROAD

I
Wait till dawn to sail
Through green country again.
Here, near a bamboo wall,
Wildgeese crow; men idle.
Wildgeese, alert, gallant:
I am their flier.
Can anyone guess me, beyond the water?
I am green and have round sails....
Yet am I wise, quick, and
