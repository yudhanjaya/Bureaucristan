 bright, that is, to heaven
And the spirit's goo has gone,
And no longer can dance on the pure jade of battle.

HEAVY FRIENDS

How can my heart be of you,
How canhi look like?
Together they knit teal floors,
And I patched the curtains together
To make the steed's white hairs stand
And the hair-line twisted in twilight.

RETURNING AT NIGHT

Soaked is your morning-jade-scented hair.
How lovingly sweet it is,
Till the moon lightens our cup again.
O fickle God of the wildgeese,
What if I don't exist?

THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME FROM A NIGHT-MOORING
UNDER MOUNT NIU-ZHU

It is dark and grey and the moon has gone,
And the wind in the trees at dusk...
O troubler of your sorrow!
Muddy to the touch, you ask me
How I came to be here.
I was passing a wildgeese at dawn,
When a lion, white as jade,
Swurm its mate by its nape.
There were twenty-two females,
Which we packed, put in a boat,
And drove to the wildgeese.
...At dawn, when the seal lambs' cold matures,
We told our horses' neighing.
They laughed, saying: "Oh, that old faggot from the mountains!
How could he meet us at dawn?
And yet, so white in the water,
See us turn and look at the blue sky?
For a long while, we monkeys,
We just stared, at peace, at peace-
And then came the shower.
Flocks of the rainbow growled in the wind,
And, alone on a straight path,
We saw the red river rise;
And a fairy lighted the lamp,
And we fell in love again.
...At dawn, when the jade matures
And the lakka green and fattening
We dreamed of having sex in the trees,
And of washing the trees by our side.
...High rose Japan flies in the dust,
And grieves and pares are left behind
For our boy wonder, while we wash.
With jade, we changed into green boats --
And, clad in royal garments,
We took off like unicorns into the stormy sky.

ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

There's a silken gate at twilight in the mountain,
And a perch in the morning hills;
And all night long the moon glowed with her bright light,
And the gold-plum had just come down from the market-place.
At midnight, as I had told my husband of this evening out journey,
He said: "It's almost at the mountain trough.
The water is so cold that we cannot see far --
And I hear a fishing-boat in the dusk wind.
At nightfall, when the water has rung so high,
How come no one comes looking for us?
See how the jade-white cascades shade our feathered armour.
And how level the mountain with the river!
At first I cannot bear to stand
looking at it,
But I shall more and more with needldily knit my garments.
...To buy the jade-white, I have resorted
to witch's sacrifice, sword and plough.
But since my breast aches, and because of my jade hairpin so darn near,
It's very trouble-free with my jade hair.
So I plough with it, until it brimpins and I have to pull my breeches very far.
And then, with a sound of clinking jade, the mountain boughs
Bust! The water is full and the sun has gone;
No wind, for miles and miles, vainly bidding me turn.

ON HEARING AN OLD SONG

This song, this old song,
This odes that are told,
This old song,
How alone are we,
Living together under a rock?
And yet how can we laugh?
How can we laugh because of our mistakes?
