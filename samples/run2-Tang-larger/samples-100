Both, for all his skill in magic, neither wielded the staff of magic nor mastered magic at all, he was slow in lifting his staff from a black rock.

...Then he went out and found the lost staff in the shadowy gloom of a cave.
There he turned, in the darkness, and asked the frost to return.
The frost vanished, and now with one glance at the staff and its hidden meaning,
He could see far and wide the whole city.
And there he was again, alone among the frosty clouds,
In the twilight of a strange moonlight,
And yet at last he asked the frosty moon to bring it back.

...The great poet Enchanted Mirror, a work of work by Enchanted Mirror,
An ancient symbol of death and eternal gloom,
The master of colour and of shadow, the original spirit and original purpose,
With its original colour and that of its own accord,
With its original scale and colour and scale and scale,
With its single colour, its single scale,
With its single dimension, its single dimension,
Where beyond all scale the air of being fills the whole and the earth of seeing,
Where beyond all scale the spirit of man is banished,
Where beyond all scale the eternal dawn,

Where beyond all scale the sun shines,
So that even gods, after all creation,
Have nowhere to turn for them now.
And Enchanted Mirror, the greatest work of art of art,
All its marvels concentrated in a single spot
And its original, its original scale, now seem at peace in its midst,
With nothing beyond what might be called perfection,
With nothing but the most essential element of beauty:
With nothing in the other who has not heard the art,
With everything in the one who, because of his great heritage,
Has lived to see beyond the world,
Nothing but the perfections, the sharpened features
Of the finest of a few, the finest of many.
And all these, O Enchanted Mirror, I have marked,
Inspired, and copied, and copied and copied
Where beauty comes from a single source,
Where beauty is the gift of the heart,
Where beauty is achieved by the wayside,
Where beauty is achieved through luck,
Where beauty comes and goes without precedent,
Where beauty, in the final analysis,
Is the work of only the finest.

TOWER-SNOW

In the west, where autumn is rare and far-reaching,
Stones of jade grow frosty from the south,
And in the southwest, east, yellow lilies grow dead in the spring,
O my brothers and sisters! - I am raising my staff.
Here, in my stone jade-pan, do you see dragons?
There, in my crystal crystal cup, are the remains of dragons!
...My master, the great wizard of the ancient days,
Was born in a mountain, in a sea, a thousand miles;
He descended through the seven heaven-faction,
He spread over one land, throughout eight regions;
His kingdom came to an end, when he alone was vanquished.
...Now, when a wizard is crowned by a thousand states,
Where is the old blood left?
With this cup is brought the crystal wine
And the cup the wine, all drunk with one breath.
...How few wanderers, and how quiet the fisher-boat,
How sweet and safe the river,
How resplendent the mountains,
How bright and resplendent the valleys,
How long have we lived without a king?
With this jade cup is brought the drink,
The old wine and the new:
Stones of gold and of silver and of yellow cork.
I swallow it one by one, until I swallow my nut.
...Oh, if fate would loosen the strings and hold me aloof?
Alone and alone I am, in the western woods,
A wilderness filled with birds and reptiles,
With little food for the wildgeese, the mulberry-planting,
And the yellowing of the wildgeese gulls.
...To my southern end of the mountain-village,
Far out rises a wild deer,
Wild enough to eat, but far too few to control.

THE CITY-ZONE

In the far sky the lonely and the bright
Shall meet, in a single lonely footprint,
The City of the Phoenix?

THE CAST-OFF

Sagittarius, centipede, are you listening now to the call of the cicadas,
The City of the Phoenix.
The autumn air is sweet with the autumn leaves,
The flowers are warm with the evening breeze.
...In The Wind of Winter, when shall we call it quits?
