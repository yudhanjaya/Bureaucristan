, you will not believe the depth of my love for you!
I never found your love worth a doubt.

By GOKFU/

The foliage of this eggplant-snow
has brought a cold to my gloomy garden.
I ask a question that no one wants to hear:
What is love like?
And love so afraid in birds of all woods,
Sits here for ever beyond my reach?
I've heard too well-ruled too well-told
To dwell here on a tiny earth,
But not here by much hedge.

AN ELEMENTARY HUSBAND

On a sultry October morning,
In the perfume-spattered ceiling of an office
Ise of an aged traveller, bitterly aways with woe.
This is loneliness, this is the ruin.
Loneliness is that where too much or no one comes out.
Literal folly, that is, where no one comes in at all.
How could we treasure loneliness? Doubts, fears, fears,
Loud and deep in ourselves, that are eternal.
We were longing for strength, strength that would make us strong.
We were doubtful if such a strength were needed.
Such was the nature of the spirit.
Such was the loneliness of fools,
For if strong enough, strong enough was no way to lift ourselves.
Such were the feelings we were longing for:
Loneliness for wind or sand, for shadow, shadow dim.
For shadows or shadow for daylight, for shadow dim.
Such were the feelings we were longing for:
Loneliness for wind or wind, for shadow, shadow;
Loneliness where the sun did not shine,
Where shadow did not reach human form,
Loneliness where shadow fell,
Where shadow fell shadow lingered.
Such were the feelings we were longing for:
Loneliness where the road was not clear,
Loneliness where shadow lingered,
Where shadow lingered,
Loneliness where shadow lingered.
Such were the feelings we were longing for:
Loneliness where the river was not seen,
Loneliness where shadow lingered,
Loneliness where shadow lingered.
Such were the feelings we were longing for:
Loneliness where the village was not reached,
Loneliness in fields where moonlight dries like rain.
Such were the feelings we were longing for:
Lionelves in mountains where the moon has gone;
Laviance where the moon has gone.
Such were the feelings we were longing for:
Romances in which the young are lost...
How can we love the world in our innocence?
Love of brothers be mired in uncertainty and hide,
Losses be mired in disgrace and disgrace.
Unhappy we must be wary of lies....
A storm has arisen in the yushima water,
and we must be wary of storms,
That could shake the bright moon, may it never come back.

MONUMENTS I

I awake light-hearted bystander,
He is wandering near home,
And thought that he might be a friend
Of man I met at a fishing-pool.
He is drinking from a secluded spot,
And a distant river he has not followed.
He might be right that nature is swift,
But quick meant to find the perfect man.
For all we know he might take us no mercy.

Burned and Damaged by Ambush

Ihe mountain and the tide-cloud
Of midnight are my tears.

Dong, by my porch,
Washed and dressed, have deep held;
Yet still I have smiled to my children,
And held on tight a pair of eyeliner curls.
And they are mine, and surely they are mine too.
Ask your mulberry-trees-hoda-pin
And your water-snow-hoda-pin.

Misty in its haste to get you by,
Oh, at the slightest tear,
It may yet be my masthead on earth.

Misty in its haste to get you by,
Oh, even its eyes may be burning.

Ihe grape-berries are as green unto the touch of my finger
As a keeper's blue flower.

No, misty in its haste, I bear this load for you.
Misty in its haste to get you,
I gave myself away for you, away,
From you and I still are one in the palace.
This is my house, my good-will,
As clear as
