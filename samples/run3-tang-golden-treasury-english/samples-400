THE WOODPOOL 

A horseman from Tewksbury, 

What do horseman from the woods bear? 



259 



THE HUE STONE 

The tooth of the root, 
What's the least graver of them all.

TIPPLE DRUM 

A little rose-gold dill, 
A little blue-bristled damask, 
Where peach-blossoms make a bed of 
The soil of Du Chuan, 
One may be thought that spring rolls round at night 
On a sandy plain, perhaps, 
With no rain showers or wintry levels; 
But this is not what I am talking about; 
A crustacean on a pitch, 
Birds at mid-leaves, the melancholy waters of 
The moon at my western bar 
Seem to be the sounds of my ear. 

The moon is low and a faint beat, 
The birds are gone, the water is too low, 
The waters are too cold for my ears.

TIPPLE DRUM 

A lilting plum, 
Thought seems at last, 
To be letting go of 
It has dropped with no word of reprieve, 
And seems there by no clinging clinging. 
The morrow is quiet and some one has 
To be trying, singing the old cicadas.

THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME 

You want news from your old home, 

Where war has torn the leaves from your autumn sails. 

But spring, away from the house, out for a walk. 
What are you doing out in the yard, 
Up a steps, you say? What are you going on about? 

There are no tears all day, all day long. 
Nothing to feel sad about, nothing to feel sad 
About tomorrow, except the bugle-call of birds. 

Three thousand miles, all of them, gone from you, 

Weren't they? You know. 

263 



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME 

Your old yard's not far from the river, 

Far from the birds that are going straight for your yard. 

You know where we go, we think. 
We make our complaint of the day straight. 

Tomorrow we'll come back again. 

We'll start again. We'll pass by, 

And we'll think of you again. 

You know nothing of our house besides tales. 

264 



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME 

There's a tune-bearer in the bell: 

"It tinkers on the cypress 
Like a grain of dew on a grain of grass, 

A stone crackling in the sun; 

Something is amiss. What's the matter? 

It's no big deal. No more of this. 

The tune-bearer is yours. 

What are you going to do with us, 

When we're gone? We're gone.

A TEMPLE ON THE HERMIT BEAUTY 

Master, I have laid my head on your knee. 

I laid mine between your eyebrows, 
Here on my thumb; and 

With a long finger, I show you 

My sacred habit 
Not only my own, though, but one within the 

GPS of many a close and distant home. 

When I was a boy, for example, 

I never saw or heard, or saw not, 

My father bury his dead body on a flat rock, 

On which I have no memorial row, 

The sand and dust of history, 

The lack of one memorial habit, 

In my district, 

My father's sons' graves, too.

TO THE RIGHT MOIN

On a little straw heap at the border 

And without the aid of a torch, 

All my youth I beencoming forth, 

And pursued in every way, 

With all the strength I could muster. 

No one but me has any right to wander. 

No one but you will please to forget. 

What am I to
