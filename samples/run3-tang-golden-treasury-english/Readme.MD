## For this run, I added Western poetry. 
Namely, "The Poems of Robert Frost" from https://archive.org/stream/poemsofrobertfro029898mbp/poemsofrobertfro029898mbp_djvu.txt

I assumed that Frost had more in common with the Tang poets than any other English poem I know - many of his most famous poems are about capturing that moment, freezing it, and using relatively simple language to capture more intimate emotion.

This went straight to the weird at 600 cycles:

065ilo 4/ï¿½/ (Blind Encounter)

By GOKFU/

The foliage of this eggplant-snow
has brought a cold to my gloomy garden.
I ask a question that no one wants to hear:
What is love like?
And love so afraid in birds of all woods,
Sits here for ever beyond my reach?
I've heard too well-ruled too well-told
To dwell here on a tiny earth,
But not here by much hedge.

```

```
THE TEMPLE OF THE PREMIER OF SHU

Sometimes in the tenth year of Yuan she endured an abject 
Insuficail. She strove for beauty, but could not 
Make herself slender enough to look upon, or proud enough 
To look upon her place as a symbol of virtue. 
She duked it out at age thirty-five 
And, though at Emperors downdes and vice-downdes, 
She curbed her pride at thirty-seven. 
Her body was of royal jade worth a hundred robes, 
And, though at Emperors woos and reveres, 
Her lustre and her value did not daunt 
Her if left unbridled. Her lustre 
Was an infinite stream of blood and smoke and waste hair. 
Her dignity was at stake, and no life was safe. 
If she had not spoiled the fire with a putrid yolk, 
The point of a putrid yolk could be pierce through her pride. 
The point of a putrid yolk could fatten a man's heart. 
And if lustration were not cruel, 
If set against the will of reason, 
What if it not be? 

```
There's some promise at 400:
``` 
 TEMPLE ON THE HERMIT BEAUTY 

Master, I have laid my head on your knee. 
I laid mine between your eyebrows, 
Here on my thumb; and 
With a long finger, I show you 
My sacred habit 
Not only my own, though, but one within the 
GPS of many a close and distant home. 
When I was a boy, for example, 
I never saw or heard, or saw not, 
My father bury his dead body on a flat rock, 
On which I have no memorial row, 
The sand and dust of history, 
The lack of one memorial habit, 
In my district, 
My father's sons' graves, too. 

``` 
(Yes, apart from the GPS)

And at 300 we have a fine hint of sexual innuendo:


``` 
THE HOLIDAY SONG

I spent the night in the palace-cum-village of
Confucius, waiting.
Washing in the freshets of silk,
I had the honour of receiving the gayest of raindrops,
That green between the eyebrows, and down to my bare palm.
And later in the day a maid, who had just come in from school,
She opened the book-case and exposed the paper-work of the gayest girl.
She showed me holy water, a fire-bugle,
A lamp post, a light post,
A recliner's post, an entertainer's post.
She led me to a sacred lake,
To a princess' palace, in her rue des Anglais;
There she showed me the gayest girl she knew.
'Don't let her do you any harm,' she commanded, 'let her love you. If she loves you so much, she may as well be your lover.
Be gentle and respectful of her, and let her be your lover.'
...This expression, which is usually reserved for lovers of brothers and sisters.

``` 

But now there is just he barest hint of the Tang left, and there are subtle language mismatches across the board - the much older Tang poets, translated, sound more contemporary than this Englishman. 

This is interesting, but I suspect this corpus will have to be balanced a bit better for the kind of voice I want for OSUN. Tabling this for now and reverting to a cleaner version of the Tang corpus.
