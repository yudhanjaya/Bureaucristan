======================================== SAMPLE 101 ========================================
This level of hardship is assigned to a great general by the white flag,
Yet still he is at the front, holding his iron staff.
Fighting is assigned duties on the part of the hero.
The Chinese will be gladiators, but not cyclists.
So you Engineers, who have mastered the art of warfare,
Have failed to crush the most formidable foe.
...Charged with the difficult feat of crushing the greatest,
The Huamen Six have five hundred men dead areas from which to plant your explosives.
The formidable Danube Mountains, across which you have marched,
Are, today, called Terrace Sahams.
See how Cao's generals wear greyes night in and night out.
Dawn is our Emperor's refuge, on his green slope
After which he strokes his dagger shy of a fang nor thinks of a battle.
...War-clouds are spreading, under the Helan Range;
Trees ripen, lakes and rivers are mounded, all across the world.
A hundred battles a day needs fighting men
And no one anywhere near the pot of gold.
But who needs fame when people are praising you.
...Engines drown in world-ruled China's sea;
Doubt not that greatness comes to those who know no god.
...kneel and wonder at the marvel of modern-day China.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Last night, while a dancing-fly was offering congratulations,
There came a sound of moons and clouds across the sea.
For years the Kingdom of Korea has been bombed --
Everywhere opened and shut away;
There were hoof to hoofs in the empty palace.
But now the war-heat is paid with a few drums --
And the Princesses of O by the Emperor's Court, enjoying
War-Pure hell!
Oh, how can human hearts blossom in spring?
War-Once more, before the zenith of dawn,
Let men rejoice in victory!
Let soldiers, with brotherly hands, collaborative genius
Enjoy the peace of spring like guests!


A SONG OF GLASSES OF THE MOON

Her golden locks shew through the dew of autumn;
Her bronze resplendent in the sun,
Her guitar playing twice as often
Not a sound of fall but deep sighs come over the sea.
...The river, to its limits, has run many miles.
The five Holy Mountains no more;
Bears cannot circle them secure-hand,
And Tartar girls grow brown-haired and gay
And Husk boys pale in the sunset.
...The Dragon Lake, impassable duelling drags;
Bears move it like a columns of clouds;
And fishermen tie it with a line of waves
And wheels of misty Lake Zhongnan.
...From the cloudy cliffs past the palace, white with dawn,
Grey clouds are piercing the pale moonlight.
...The soldiers of the strong general leave the west,
And bear day and night in the Lake of the Dragon Dragon pulse
On metal poles and wicker mats of silk.
...heathens row about the town, cursing it evil-doers,
Over and underweight bears make silver pennies.
...The fishermen, fearing retribution from the dragoons
Who occupy the southern rivers, wave our quotas too early.
And Central Princess Diana, swaggering, charges our fishing
Into the Great Lake-Sagoon Array.


AT AN EXAMINATION

At Last Again! -- Perplexed, for Hadakah
That spring-time had suddenly become a festival,
And Hadakogs, turkeys, hadros known them,
All naked from the water to their furrows.
...Round the Hadak roof a mistseeming darkness
Has arisen from the deep pine-lands,
To lead a bird, a birdseed,
To a new-scattered mistheroiltrace of birds.
...The king has learned that Hadakrass are everwatch,
Watching raptors from the wild horses --
Watching these white birds, white with jade,
On Hadak cliffs sundered hundreds of years ago.


ON HEARING DONG PLAY THE FLAGEOLET
A POEM TO PALACE-ATTENDANT FANG

The palace-attendant hung from the golden whip of nature
And took to a harp and a poem, asking the questions
Which flew past the wandering bird: "To-day the flageolet of spring
Where mist from the wide arch of the world;
"To the east of the Eastern Gate a green deer is tending;
"Beyond that green mountain a melancholy bird is singing....
The General Farooqui, in his Golden Mirror,

THANK YOU FOR SHOOTING!
YOU STILL HAVE HAPPINESS IN THE NORTH

Outside Looking-Glass;
Outside the Mannifestr Gate;
Across the Green Sea from there
To a mountain peak a long way house.
You are still alive though.
You have recovered from your battle --
Though your life has been almost all gone.
...Sagacious as you are with your battlements
Toward a battle-place that has not yet been captured
Than,ing your song of surrender,
Fleets of birds are scurrying among the grasses.
...Red leaves are twining, and the silver string has been snapped.
...There are red berries in the cup that is falling,
There are golden tallion-rows, indestructible;
And, grateful for this season of great fruit,
There are fisher-boats in the opposite direction.


TAKING LEAVE OF WANG WEI

Slow and stooped since our fall, I haveto go of you
This very first morning, all alone in the garden....
You are raising a flock of peacocks, not yet hatched,
And I wonder how many of my fellow birds were born last night.
...Angels flying high up in the sky, some of them mighty,
Just as angels who have never flown a skiff,
Have swooped low and gone homeward,
While human birds wane and slow going....
And highest of all these are the pined peacocks I have
See again how hard it is to fly a skiff.


LOOKING TOWARD AN INNER GATE
OF THE PREMIER OF THE LODGE

Why part the trees that are hiding the street-sign?
Because of the way in which they shape the landscape-plant;
Alas, snow-flies have blown part of the north gate
And through snow-rifts runs over the south river.
...After a night in the trees of Wu,
I hear, on stone in the wind, calls coming from the east.
...I have come, when I really need be heard,
A messenger from the Yang Temple.
Your message has been sent.
Preparing me food and lodging, in the late spring-wood,
I fling aside my old struggles!


A NIGHT-MOORING NEAR MAPLE BRIDGE

As I crow my way through the fog,
I bewail my graveyards below;
Apes attack, crow flies; hawks are dead;
The trees in the South Gate run dry;
And the morning sky is shrouded in misty clouds....
I barreled north from the Capital,
reading, writing, and then vanished,
As I turn in the slanting sun....
The needle in a jade can, in the weaving of elves,
Be a rapid-running hand, a warrior's art.
Du Fu artisans usu, Huayi artisans usu.
Poets, express your love,
Here in my poem.


CLIMBING IN AUTUMN FOR A VIEW FROM THE TEMPLE
ON THE TERRACE OF GENERAL WU

So autumn breaks my homesick heart....
Few pilgrims venture climbing to a temple so wild,
Up from the lake, in the mountain clouds.
...Demonstrators gather to say farewell
To a delectable lantern.


AT CHUZHOU ON THE WESTERN STREAM

Where the sun has set beyond the range of Chinese mountains,
We have just reached the third boundary, beyond which nothing follows.
The Mother of Heaven, visiting you,
Speaking in a mellow tone,
She points to a peak beyond which flies a bird on the river.
That is our trail, our warning, our prayer;
We will pause at the last second, before the wild sky.
And we will finish our strides as before;
As the Forces of Surprise await us at the border.


AT MOUNT ZHONGNAN

The moon sets beyond the western waters,
And the wind brings us no happier tidings
But for the peace of a peaceful world.
My little boat moves on its master's riverboat,
And redoubled its efforts at planting leaves
In the flowers and mists of the pale oak,
And ended the night with a last farewell drink.
...At Yangzhou the trees have ceased helping their own branches,
And the old willow-trees blow their own leaves.
On the water we hear a whimper,
On the shell of a nearby boat sound a hook,
And at Chujiang a boat arrives home.
His fishing-boat is white with dew,
His brothers and he hungry beyond endurance.
He picks at a slip

A MOORING UNDER MAPLE

Under the Phoenix River there is nothing to hear
But strings and amorous groomsmen cower,
Their voices broken with anxiety.


A MESSAGE TO WANG

I am a cloud spreading my white cloud:
Applying for a visa in the morning
I cross the Yellow River to see if any of my kin are aboard.


BORDER-SONGS III

Red brush thick with rain now yields to yellow clouds
And the mountains of Chu are torches from this month of the year.
I pack my things and leave the way of the River of Stars;
I listen to a bard in dawn seeking address;
I am taken away from my kin by a wild goose.


A SONG OF THE SPRING PALACE

Time was long ago and sea and sky were wild with the moon;
And southward came the calling of a spring-cone dove,
Where birds were flying homeward over the sand,
And trees were blessing centerland over the mountain.


BORDER-SONGS IV

Let feasting begin in the wild camp!
Let bugles cry our victory!
Let us drink, let us dance in our golden armour!
Let us thunder in our golden armour and spear thousands of feet!


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Her tears are spent, her voice is distressed.
She sings a sad song of her doomed lover;
A LUTE-PLAYER-SONG

How beautiful water-floes can sway;
Yet not the kind of breeze
That clouds our homes;
Not even a chill from a war- cave,
That leaves our villages green with dew
And no one to us to watch us.


BORDER-SONGS V

Her tears are spent, her voice is distressed.
She and her husband sail on the bank of the Lake of the Little White Mountain
And her eyes never stay fixed on the King of Wei
Where the Lake of the Little White Mountain extends its western half.
...The officers of the watch-merchant hail from a whirlwind
That day thefe is bound for Zunogo,
A long road that leads to the Blue Palace.


A SONG OF The Dragon Lake Gai

Bearing hopscotches drawn, I step into the wild night
And stare at the moonlight descending King Mountain.
Ranging from phoenix to unicorn, I am cursing
For rushing so soon after breakfast.


BORDER-SONGS VI

Quickly I think of a battle-brother
And I see his greybeard dejection
Whose stare I cannot block-Is fixed on a vague enemy.
...My old friend, removed from the earth,
Shadows your face in the rugged land
Where ravenous wolves stalk our westward mountains.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

My brush with peace since the war
Has left me no name but Angry Dragon.
...The year is only three months old.
Will that be the beginning of imperial wrath?
The scale of Imperial City-rise darkens with rain.
...The butcher's knife edits its work
Like a screen cut out by a madman.


BORDER-SONGS VII

Time was long before I met my friend
And, from that early age, used to being loved by sisters
Except as dancers in the brothels of the Temple.
So open a girl's eye and let her be forever transformed
By the chariot races of the River and the Dragon Gorges.


BORDER-SONGS VIII

Tarrying fish and meat with my lone wild-goose,
I slim a-nighthashing in the Blue Sea.
Yet freaks are seen bounding sea-tide
Between worlds hovering miles white,
And maidenhood done away with the midnight bell.


A MESSAGE

My messenger, leaving the court, has left the city
And is bound home at dawn to lie by the fire
For ever and ever seeking the world.


NOTES

A stampede has swept the sand-sea
Where noon has ceased to be a duty
And people o'erwhelm the tourist-stand.
Cattle and sheep louse the banks for cover;
And a sandy-mallet is lying on all fours
That the autumn tide has stirred.



MY RETREAT AT MOUNT ZHONGNAN

My heart sank when I stood beside you
And tried to draw the ferry back again;
But you promised to take me fishing
If you could pay me

At first I cannot see him.
His hair has no scent.
His face is cold and sleepy.
His fingers are wet with tears.
What does he want more?
A present from his chamber?
Freedom from work!
Freedom from pain!
Our boy and girl, with horns and no horns,
Who are so young you can hardly arm a chair.
What does it matter that horns and no horns are used to your hands?
Horns are made of feathers and then of stone....
But you know what matters? Gold, made of diamonds, never fails.
Every father brings his boy to his father's offering;
But what about his son-in-law?
He brings home a box of crumbled pears and a piece of hemp
And he shreds the box with his knife.
Each day brings more tears....
But still remain firm and hold your ground!



FALLING PETALS 3

Gone is the guest from the Chamber of Rank,
And petals, confused in my little garden,
Photographing Falling Pets.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME
ON THE CHU RIVER

A cold light comes blowing slowly by.
I hear a wood-note cutting through the night.
...An old man by the river, singing,
Will soon fade into thin air.
New sounds of the river and the spring wind,
Around the wall of the old hotel.
I watch a lone wildgoose crossing the river.


ON THE BORDER

Where are your Imperial Green Books? --
Thoughtful words that will heart-felt make you whole-hearted,
According to which all cattle on the frontier are killed,
And all your friends by the south gate are taken out of town.
...Wait till the bandits in White Wolf Mountain turn up again,
And the south gate again is made of ash and dust....
The lonely drops of your water-clock are missing --
People are still out in the open....
And of late trouble it has arisen that all your troops should be killed,
Lieutenants are sick, generals wounded,
How many more are you going,
While this drab wilderness lasts for ever the stars.


ON NEW YEAR'S EVE

Farther and farther from the three Ba Roads I have been burying your remains,
With the quiet distance between prayer and mourning lessened.
...Separation from my husband of Green Mountain and I are only hours away.
I turn and see the long river that runs beyond Changan in width
Breathing new life into the piercing sun.
The flowers that blooming season have barely covered the boughs,
And the head of a flower-spirit has been concealed in a jade cap.
On the bank a horse neighs and a bird caws.
A sky of mist and clouds is between us and death,
And the sea-town of Qin is a ruin to look out for.
...I leave my post and am dismissed.
How much wider life goes!
What are our thoughts, then?
AFTER MY FAVOURITE LONG-TEREYED
TO MY FOUR FELLOW-OFFICIALS
IN QUONG HAN AND TONGHU

Roused from their long wait in Yangzhou's underground chambers
To find one another outside the southern mountains,
These four quarters seem to hold together through the haze
As they meet this man from Qin who, seated next to her, has just opened the seal
And has finely wrought a new crescent-case.
She has carved a man-size cross on the cross,
Made of ripples of silk, of pearls of gold;
She has twisted a triplet to his will --
And, lo, is calculating well ahead
That he may take his talents home with him to the capital.



THE TERRACE OF THE BUDDHIST PILGRIM LEI

The rulers of the Three Kingdoms had three Holy Mountains,
Yet no one built a city on the third, fourth or even of the three Mountains.
So Pruxes, king of the River-Gates, built a temple to the spirits
Which has been done by many Sufi poets, just as in the old days.
And Buddhas, the breath of life, illumine the soul
And cause the sick to thirst for stores,
And songs of the Edict proclaim: "Let gods rule the world."



BOTH JIANDET & I

When The Red Lotus was granting life
To those who were dying a slow and fast death was no way.
And Had the Enchanted Car Go Down Authority On Momonga And Mixed It With Toad Seeds?
Instead Of these Iconoclast Roles
My Grandfather Was a Great Grandfather.

FORD, DAESTIC II

There are rarer songs of spring in this eastern city,
Yet here are so many phrases of spring.
There were wars and sighs of relief
Sometimes, late in the night, you close your door and wonder
What is to befall me of this world?


FAREWELL TO GOVERNOR LI

There is a gleam of green in a distant tree --
And there is a gleam of white wine in a long cold breath.
Time has not yet faded beyond our hand --
And the North Star has entered the crystal desert of Lake Dongting.


IN THE QIN CITY AT SEA

Time has not yet run its course
A hundred miles a day? --
Till now I find my home --
A city-gate that winds through the misty rain.


AT CHUZHOU ON THE WILD RIVER

By this point in the river, at the border where wolves can never cross,
I can see the waves of the north ocean rising.
And yet I am not coming home at all.


TO VICE-PREFECT DU

With a cup of wine in every direction,
I ask myself:
How can I divert the grief of a long day? --
That which is reasonably possible,
Can sometimes be very little better.


TO VICE-PREFECT DU

There are mountains to go to,
But there are no rivers to go to.
I wonder how many lives I have left.


IN THE COLD

While the house of a man of fortune...
Lives that are short and poor,
Who are able to deal well with care;
They offer tea and pleasantries,
And nothing to disturb them,
Except some old wine being given
And singing by the new lord's window.


IN THE COLD

There are wildgeese in the evening,
Horses in the morning,
And wintry clouds at dusk....
They have a strong root melodrama
And are divided between two mountains.


IN THE COLD

The old guard beats its drums
And its men vain and idle,
Its soldiers and vanquished,
Its friends fleeing with grief.
...It is very late and the river is running cold,
So the officers come back with news of game-gods.


A SONG OF THE PAGODA

Bamboos are crying in the dusk,
And rivers and lakes are dark with dew
And people sick in City of the Red Phoenix.
It is very dark in Yangzhou and the pagoda
Gates are closed to most of us.


BOUND HOME

I sang An Heart Like Water in the Dark,
To find my husband and me home,
Alithenously cold and far-away.
...Tomorrow there might be rain
And twilight soaks my spirits;
But, since we have got-away-Artie,
Watford and Blackmun both dead,
Can you guess why I come?


A LONG CLIMB

In a sharp gale from the wide sky apes are whimpering
Around the camp-fires, trying to make its sounds regular.
Few, if any, are home, and the flame is spreading.
Far away I watch the moon go down.
I see a white crane with a gaping maw,
Till men of the white god forgive me.
I watch a naked Iowa wildgoose,
And a South Pacific porpoise running amok.
I choose a drink for my eye and hear a crow glimmer,
And I watch aflame from the camp-gate a pair of flaming wings.



TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. Sad with autumn, they have gone to the mountains.
Where are they going next month? They are scattered in two rivers.


THE TEMPLE OF THE FIRST KING OF SHU

Since the Tang and the Jin have so far depended on one another,
My brothers and sisters remain at the capital,
Living under the yoke of the Premier
Until the coming of Queen Hao.
With a flame of white mountain-coffee he places on the Tree of Peace,
And a hanging fruit of red cloud he blows to lighten my burden.
...The light of morning grows thin and my friends by the Wallace
Gathering at home again the oarings of a premier.

Henceforth he always calls his eight strings a song;
Six strings of blue water, nine strings of red cloud;
Three strings of lightning in a day,
A lone sail the colour of night.


ON HEARING JUN THE BUDDHIST MONK

Borne from home, my father died, too,
And Ling have come back from the wild goose-thrilling
Nearly two thousand miles round the Temple of the Great Monks.
...The green grave-stones here reveal the relics of old age;
Nurses and doctors come and go, rebuilding the rooms
And little by little fill the voids between rooms with cloven
Dryness and wearyness.


THROUGH THE YANGZI GORGES

Flowers, as do diplomatic and military offices,
Where soldiers have no name but to be loyal,
And children of pirates and drunken soldiers complain,
They say that the Mountain of Heaven is guarded there by spirits;
But government is a bandit causeway thinning;
And inland you will send your men, in boats of jade,
With oaths sworn to honour the flag:
But here a monk from Wuacher in a fishingboat
Lives free that he sinks in the yellow-water,
Dreading from the South Ocean the chill of a storm.


ON HEARING A LUTE-PLAYER AGOILBLING NEW PLAY THE HARP

Borne from home, my father goes to the White City
To the play the weather-god willow for thunder and lightning.
...The harangue of fortune cuts the River of Heaven.
But my breast grows pale with sorrow
While I laugh, even at tinkering.


THROUGH THE YANGZI GORGES

A Sea of Red Clay Is The Great Northwind

With China's two great rivers winding the other way
And Tallahassee a day and a night a wild goose,
There is only the autumn sea and the high rise.
...As I sail up the River of Red Clay,
Lakka-muddy water lies a thousand yards my boat;
And the river's nine turns me heart-broken
That I so bitterly remember those golden lilies,
They bamboos once gave a false hope to Tartar men.


ON MEETING A MESSENGER TO THE CAPITAL

It's a long way home, my lady.
By the bridge over the Black Sea,
There are neither grebes nor hills to follow.
...I have to travel back now from my friend's land
In a boat that has harnesses for my shoulders;
And I find your boat delayed.

But a goblet of ripples along the border

Too young to have a name,

There are many a Lady on earth
Who is humble enough to offer a sacrifice
But sadder still to offer it to a Burmese orion.

Nor die of thirst like other men.Sunset are torches your kin's homesick tears;

And lonely stones in the year are stirring your lonely nights....

MY BROTHERS RETREAT AS FAR AGO
AT HIS TERRACE ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

Last night his horse came running toward the village.
He has come three thousand miles away;
And then to find me that the north wind has stopped,
He has found my white-streaked window and my red-green mountain
Bird's-eye view of the river.
His temple has been looted, and he has lost his wife.
His vestments all are undone, and he has no one to look out for them,
Yesterday he shed tears in the dusk, and today he posted a bounty on his wall.
The moon is hard on his lonely desertion-watch,
But the stars are high with cloud and rain.



MY BROTHERS RETREAT AS FAR AGO
AT HIS TERRACE ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

My heart has been heavy all day long
Because of your dance, my hair has pounded;
I wish I could play The Rainbow Skirt,
I wish I could sing The Song of Bright Spring.
...The thousand sounds fill the shortwave,
Like the wind cutting the grass near your west tower.
I am coming back westward, I wish I could send you letters;
I am lying in a lace-up chair for three months,
And you know how to stroke your tongue after I tell you.
...The stars make noise when I go
As you have come three thousand miles without me.


AT A GATE-TOWER IN YUZHOU

Where the sun has shone endlessly
On the Forbidden City, River of Heaven, since the first shot was fired,
I hear a stone gong, the autumn sky is cold,
The city pinesky with its brook, and the water is cold with a waterfall.
...How much longer can I commandeer you grass-roots that have been broken?
...At a little gate post on the low slope that leads to the tall tower,
I watch the rising moon go down an old song.


IN A DREAM HEARTBREAK

Gone is the old likler who was eager to be known
As the sweet voice of a wildgoose,
And has changed his patterned coat and gray cap to yellow fever high.
He is gone forever, going nowhere. He is a wildgoose in a field.
LOST WITH THE VILLAGE

His lost love, lost in the valley of the flying bird,
Lives in five rooms in a big, dinghy that lets out no wind.
...When fluttering under his wing
Vainly healthy Seyyin befriends her caveman jade,
How long shall Luangoran be without you,
Lifting from his golden chair a cup of winecups by the fire?
...He knows me only as Yam-Thun, and he knows me only by my green paan.
What are these green butterflies doing at midnight,
After the moon has vanished?
...真 IN A DREAM PALACE

Waiting for my old friend to return from his flight,
I am waiting for my old friend's palaceside mirror.
Anticipating his friend's return,
West of the Hill of Gold,
Flowers do their work for the northern lights;
But here, east of the Hill of Yellow Flowers,
Are the Thousand-Morse Swan's stare.


Waiting for my old friend to return from a flight
So far a journey goes, yet no word has come from Luoyang
From Chu to Nanjing Breaking waterfalls is hard,
Seeing for water only to cross again Sea-Shares are long.
...I faint, I intuit
What is it like here? Nothing but the slanting sun.
I think of Jia Yi, who taught here and died here-
And who born again is here.
...Woman, even before your eyes,
Is turning back home to her mother's valley --
And you, aiding her, have gone on going,
Living like royalty before the Split Sun.

CLIMBING ON A TRIP TO THE TEMPLE
TO WHICH AREA SONG, CENSOR'S MEETING WITH HIS BROTHERS

Cock-crow, the bridal is galloping up the mountain
Singing a song of thanksgiver;
Moon-stone, the bride's companion,
Epiphany-light, washing the tears away
From the startled birds that are all-absorbing
The Emperor marches westward in his golden vest;
Attendants line the walls of the temple, moonlight reaching
Church bells ringing.
The sand is thick with identification, the fisherman's boat watery.
We know he is from Wu; he is near the mouth of the Huai.
I watch him through the pines of Red Mountain
Where brown clouds are stirring the evening war.


A MESSAGE TO HAN CHO THE YANGZHOU MAGISTRATE

From here I must leave my passionate lover, my life has been spared
From the world the bitterness of a mission abseiling in heaven.
We joked together many years, left each other little chance
And soon he was alone with his celestial rosy-eyed sister.
Thinking of you he asked me his full name.
And letting your cold smile hide your face,
You asked only that you might talk to me of your oceanside estate.
...After an evening of quieted-away wine,
Into a porch painted with the Song Mountain Mound.



A SONG OF AN ANIMALS

On a northern peak a thousand mountainside
Tame an immortil-gorge and a new-spinion of grasses;
On a southern peak the waters approach snows and no wind;
On aity simple and yet beautiful,
The Chinese people gather and brood, gathering in carven clouds.
...Night has opened the Great Gatsby,
And the water has turned the lane of a dream into a river;
And with twilight approaching cuckoos,
Bring in the dawn from sea-
Klinging mastiffs and gentlemen.



A SONG OF THE PALACE

Now that the palace-gate has softly closed on its flowers,
A lantern's gleam has entered the old palace;
The flowers that were sweetling a morning theluscious
And the imperial limpidace smoothly turning green
Are gone forever that air of surrender
That you step out from the Great Hall toward the cold spring.
...The tear-drops are falling like a girl s flag on a dawn
Rain that has come through the guttering of houses,
Birds that were caring for a sick relative home in Wu
Are singing home their home-made wings back home.


Cicadas are in the capital bringing in the brisk rain
That has come a hundred thousand winds of change
Over the roofs and in the houses, till the royal harp is sighing
And a western bystander notices a cicada
Dancing on its fluted silk fan.


EAST OF THE TOWN

A hundred miles from the capital,
On a road by the post of imperial collectables,
Cicadas are wailing there in the dark
And children of Tibet are waiting in the bright dusk
About a stone's throw from our camps the cliffs are falling away;
And at dawn we separate from our friends-
And at dusk we cross the Dan River,
While our horses gallop mutely.


ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
THINKING OF MY BROTHERS IN SHANDONG

How differently to read an annunciation
How differently I men meld marriage and families;
But who as with you has never seen the big moon
Toward the south wind and rain.


IN MY LODGE AT THE SOUTH STUDY
AFTER A MOONLIGHT

The tombs across the street from this one make me sick
Because of the cold dawn;
But the pupils of the boys in the south
Are bright with memory now of spring
And nights of peace in the palace gardens.


THEORETICAL NOTEBOOK LETTERS

How often should I cite The Rainbow Skirt --
Yet, for the TONS OF GOLD IN MAPLE COURT

These inscriptions here and there are like stars --
But I am stronger than they are.
 Like fire-flies, in pairs, hanging from my through-hole
I want only the Squadron Blue sky, for there is nobody there.


A MESSAGE FROM MESSAGE LIEUTENANT PEI
TO GOVERNOR LI in Time of Peace
Has killed ten thousand before me;
And my fame has waned like that of a maiden
Who calls my seven year old son.



THE GE
======================================== SAMPLE 109 ========================================
Throughout his life his lust for girls had reached its pinnacle.
By the time he had transcended the fifth wall of palace,
The beauties of Diana, Heloise, Bengala,
Had set beside him on a golden rope the melody of spring
Died at the cup of his need rather than his love,
Spin his empty heart on the Emperor's green screen.
And finally he was sated at the waist: five sages had summoned
He had bounded to the top of the mountain, each with his bow
But bees and flies lost their way, while his own fancy
And reached the slanting sun of Li.
And the rapidity with which he had driven himself
Made the poor of the city of a hundred flowers.
And as he went further and had a look with which the Premier bowed,
The blush of surprise crossed his white and swept his sleeve:
"There's no one like her! Where is the throne she is headed?
There are wildgeese and geese in the yellow dusk,
There are linden by the golden gate terrified at flies that are flying
And women and children of the palace crying over the scare they are in
With no thought of a happy-ever-after;
And few people can endure the shock of seeing such a great man
And of a place of great sadness.



A SONG OF PEACH-BLOSSOM RIVER

A track of wild plum-leaves in the evening,
But a window of plum-leaves in the morning,
Why do people come here who live forever?
...It is not as they might think,
To live as nomads and transient;
And it is worse than exile.
For one thing, this southern lake is full of bugles --
And a thousand things are wrong with the region
Except the one thing that is right with the world.



BOTH SIDES OF THE YELLOW RIVER
RECAPTURED AT A SONG OF THE PALACE

By Navy Ferry No. III

We sent together Steward of the Pearl Lands to request permission to use the name Yellow Road --
And to make a town of it, east of the southern gate.
We plough there by three conquerors,
The first to break the rock at Yuyang,
The second to blow it up west at the Gate of Gold.
...The palace-girls, coming south,
Were picking flowers, conducting dances,
And yesterday went home.
Today came the rain, and the Emperor, riding a pony,
Grasses endless blue mountains,
His carriage lost his cover and he fell, like a vestige of a before
Milk-Country, in the dreary mist.



A POEM ON THE TEMPLE OF THE MOON
TO PREMIER OF ZHONGNAN

Line after line has flown back over the Temple of the Moon.
From green grasses along the border between Yin and Lu and the ring of rice
And barley on the border of Yueh to the Tartar chieftain's cave,
There are flags now above the Dao-Sha, and the Chinese priest comes to his tent,
He sees in the sunset the pale moonlight,
He knows that rain will rain on the whole earth,
And that saddened wives' hearts may be broken
For a man so doomed as I am.


AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE QIU DISTRICT

How often do I to my cottage in the QIU district
Find the complaint of a little boy.
....The trees in the morning slowly darken,
The moon in the evening, and the curtain drawn again;
The messenger, last night sent for me,
Not yethighter than in the mountains or in the rivers,
But a stranger, living on a small island,
Will be meeting me at last and will ask me where I have been.


BOTH SIDES OF THE YELLOW RIVER
RECAPTURED AT A YELLOW RIVER

By a channel across the bay from Changan, two banks of brook white are TRAPPED....
The sand is turned pale and pearly now BY THE MOUNTAIN-HOUSE,
And the broken crystal-panelled terrace is Gavoured by the Spring!
The flowers are as lone drivers are down at the brook,
Yet the solitary trob on the blue of the day is a blur now of hoof to hoof....
I will tether my boat to the sandy shore,
Blendily wander the nearer the nearer the blur.


BORDER-SONGS III

Thinking of my companion, I climb to the top.
Hisses echo through the empty mountain air.
The low moon casts a shadow into the west....

======================================== SAMPLE 110 ========================================
Bringing to you a man of highest rank,
You who are exalted to this lofty office,
Icks and Iachees away from the troubles of this world.
...Before a king or a premier takes a queen and
Demonsc immolated, these tables have turned....
The nobles and the heads of families all are well....
The mountain man has his playing-stock and his pulpit is music
And his comrade drums or plays the lute.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Her tears are spent, but no dreams come.
She can hear the others passing the palace.
They are in the dusk casting dice inside the Grand Palace.
She sees Jueing, the wife of the Emperor, in the midnight star.
The palacesgeod leader, the scornful of the nobles,
Is lying in a palace-ballroom filled with tears....
How bitterly he must must
Prepare himself for the day when he will no longer be an emperor.



BIDDING A FRIEND FAREWELL AT JINGMEN FERRY

Finches flock to hear what has happened to the ferry
From Gezhou going down the river. Looking round, I find you alone
And your companion, fisher-boy, wanders alone.
What shall I say to this wandering eagle,
When you leave me and follow me down the river?
...The ferryman may come back with more
Fish and chips, but he cannot go back yet....
Drive the fool deep in the net!


A SONG OF THE PALACE

While the palace-ballroom is turning clear of moon,
Another flight of birds has broken the calm.
Chen, the general, is missing. Why do you rush to the spot
And blame me only for what has happened?
The pity of God is with you all night in the deep.
You entrepreneurs, you looking like young men --
But you are already at the pinnacle of your fields.
The Capital of Heaven is flanked on both banks by black clouds
And the pale morning stars float between the tall grasses.
...After a night of heavy rain a dense cloud has grown thick
And the palace-girls, coming from all walks of the town,
Are picking flowers, hoping for rain,
And tending the household appliances.
...Whence is the use of the most delicate organ?
...After the shower at the Ferry-boat,
The flower-girls, the cook, setting the dishes,
All gathering, each with a basket of wine.


THE HAN RIVER

Where a dense mist grows pale over the city,
There is not one cloud left but a misty water-course.
...At sunset I wade through the Omei and land on the banks of the Hanyang.
Under the coloured rocks, I find the river still;
But below I see the river resting on the sand,
And a low mist idling the calm lake.
...The moon, descending the river, willower than heaven
And willows the thinner the trees,
And all the while will keep curling and stirring
At the wrong turn of the tide.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas complain of thin mulberry-trees
In the Eighth-month chill at the frontier pass.
Through the gate, through the bastard-boye,
We have to face with sob still we wait.
...When the flag at the border post becomes a wild goose,
How can I wear it down and pay the man?
...I will scrabble among the bushes, hoping.


PARTING AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

The Eighth-month ends, the season of the stormy sky
Which drains through the fortified city-gate.
Where are our boys? Who told me the whole story
? anywhere!


A POEM TO A TAOIST HERMIT
CHUANJIAO MOUNTAIN

My office has grown cold today;
And I suddenly think of death;
And I wonder what has happened
To my liberal heart and great mind.
...The morning-demon, with wistful eyes, calls me
Every day, till the river boots
A little way up the mountain, till the river drowns
And all those in the city-hall cry!



STAYING AT THE JIANDE RIVER

How many times have I told you that you were masterful
At planting peaches and strawberries in the blossom?
...I would lengthen my stay here by taking off my coat
And galloping alone;
but seeing as how I have good offices,
I find my fame curtailed
To those who are lost in the world.


A NIGHT-MOORING AT M
======================================== SAMPLE 111 ========================================
A BUDDHIST PRIEST INSCRIBEED IN MY LODGE AT THE PENGHAZI OUTPOST
IN MY BUDDHIST PRIEST YEARNER
IN MY LEFT COURT
AFTER A NIGHT-MOORING AT THE QIN FUQ IN THE ONLY CAVEAR

Outside are ashes of the war-torch,
Swallow fledglings freshly painted green-black.
...At midnight, when the war-rain is so heavy
That no one can ride a horseman anywhere near,
People commute by the river, enjoying the sunset.
...By dawn, near by, are reapers homing in groups.
And Animal Control makes us quench our thirst
With a smell of blood and a taste of tears.



A MESSAGE TO WUXING GENIE YANG

From your tree in the valley of the river, next door to the palace,
Buried in the middle of all these years,
Is this the valley where your friend died.
--Write to the brother of your guest at the Qin Fortress,
Tell them of your beloved gone so soon.
Dear Yang,
I am sorry for who I am or what I have happened to be in Yang.
How could I be sorry for you?
I remember the first time I took your word that I would come to you.
...When you told me you had fallen in love,
That she was from Jiangjing,
Who poorer was she in the town of Qin than I
And that she was from Wu, a poorer town?
...Yes, she was beautiful, able, quick to laugh,
Who, at the Fairy-View Court, saw every pearl
Seemed to be in state, every pearl was within sight.
...Then when Yang's bride was found guilty
And the two of them-bearers-were crucified,
And the Tower of Jade withered, it was not long before
The world's eyes could see beyond recognition
And Yang's dreams were like unto a dream.
Though they contained the words of the gods, they were too late.
...What could their sufferings have been? --
The blame for their sufferings lies with the world
And may it ever remain on the desolate mountain.
They left behind them no children, no husband,
Neither were there any graces left them.
...At the height of terror, of despair when no one could love them,
They turned from their ways and came to the Qin borderland
And sought the guidance of men who could pity them.
They called them traitors and sorcerers,
They smote Columbian horsemen with their arrows,
They wrecked the Tower of Shows with a thunder of steel,
They attacked the Twin Robises with a hundred chariots,
And the Great White God Could not save his people.
...While this disorder in state was preparing
For the worst to come, others happened.
The more prosperous the people were, the rougher their roads
And farther and farther they went.
So disposition and more will to go were three signs of prosperity.
...At Ploy the Great Wuchennya was knocked down
And now run down by ariver a cloud of tears.
...My bosoms were now to be Heng Mountain --
But a wildgoose on a row of pine-trees
Had to be leapt from the water.



TRANSITORIES IN HENG MOUNTAIN

The season of the locust, the lion's chance,
Hang in the dust along the river.
On the wall of the dormitories I watch old white bones
Borne by those who knew them, cut by those who did not.
...Though soldiers paint a grim picture of the world,
Yet art, of course, is rewarded with fame and high places.
In spite of great things, beauty comes through unspeakable things.
...I have to ask, how could a man of genius be so besotted
That all else is a dream, that of his wanderer heart always up in the air?



A MESSAGE

I am the man who knocked on the door of the famous university
And asked to see a will
And was rebuffed;
In vain went to find the money.
...I bear a child whosters still, and sigh till his tears are spent.
So start your journey, fair and simple girl,
And charmer will you the night away from home.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas complain of thin mulberry-trees
In the Eighth-month chill at the frontier pass.
Through the gate and back again, all along the road,
There is nothing anywhere but yellow reeds and sweetets
And the fight for the

The royal coral and the coronets of several states of the east
Illuminate, then, at twelve coins,
And the king only to his great Great-grandson
Have danced ten thousand songs.
And still not can throw a harp?
...Oh, at last when long ago these drums became dancers?
When drums are given the formal music of the sea?
And live drums, incorrigibly drunk,
Since first-rate musicians are only as dancers,
Then, on to the next flower, after her, under ten thousand,
Repeat the same sound three more times.



TO ONE UNNAMED II

When you were growing up like a girl,
Known only as such by the girls on the banks of the river;
And now at fifteen you are moving with your two girls
To the capital of their region, under cultivation.
Your sister, later in high rank, is then moving
Along the lane of the Capital of Heaven,
Not knowing where to begin.
...With love and no other one but your love,
The girls grow up poor and poor
And you leave home young and unknown.
At last you are president of the house of guests
And receive from all the schools and colleges
Excellent degrees in all branches of science.
...What are a country's grades,
O my chosen pupils!
Yet I hail you from my heart and make you my guest
And you remain at the northern road
Of the River of Stars and Clouds.


THROUGH THE YANGZI GORGES

From the walls of Baidi Valley to the Temple of the Yuyang Princess
In quick supply are their ingredients of spring,
Spring-creatures, resplendent with talents showing forth
All three dynasties pouring rain and shining mist.
Century after century, the few surviving are turning up dead,
With only the temples left standing for their heroes.
...War-plagued Asia-Taxi has ended,
Her daily journey is a lonely one.
...I pass a nobleman's memorial-place,
Where tidings of a holy war-call come rushing forth.
...From that distance, before a temple-place,
I have never known a town so decrepit
And as bereft of dwellings as ours.


TO ONE UNNAMED III

There are sobs when the heart of a wildgoose heart
Comes to rest in an inn at Pukou.
Where are the curtains of an inn?
...Marching to and fro, all along the coast,
There are only a few fishermen and a few farmers
And the wildgeese and the chickens all by one.
The ferryman's boat is just as soon as the ferryman is away.
...Breast-sperm is now watery and very pale,
And the staff baker's nut is just as though he were full.
And so forth we go, gathering supplies.
...Soothing the bones of departed farmers
Remind me when, ten thousand valleys apart,
Who said: 'Gathering is hard?'
The hunter and the fisherman share the bounty of their effort.
...The water does not leave the cliffs nor the cliffs-nor can it reach the town
Where pines and prairies colour the sky.


NSW FRAGRANCE

Frazer flies by a city and clouds fill the sky.
People: He is paying by his door
That of his pupil never to return.
...Marshall of China dies, his body never comes back.
Chen punish your rebellion, you will be flogged!
You rebel for ten years, your body comes back junk;
But tolerance is flabby and the head of Emperor Wangdog
Is shaved.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Be it for the wearing of a headdress by the people of Xunyang,
Zone of the northern spring, spring or winter,
Or the wind's tenacious will to repel the girl buccaneers,
Her wandering tears are rewarded with tears as thick as rice,
Which, red with spring- from the Tianzhou heat,
Makes dishes on the torches of midnight.
...If she says her girlhood you have them tattooed
On your shoulders like a grand dragon's wing:
...Let a maidservant tattoo your wings
On her palm-screen like a warrior's flag.


TO ONE UNNAMED IV

A cold wind blows from the void over the river
And the moon fades beyond sight into space.
Where are you and why are you still waiting?
...I wait for you in the shadow of the purple border
Where sand and fog have buried the city
And China's Xi Revolutionary Trail has driven him total.
You

NORTHEST PINE

There lived a Pine-cone in his little garden
Which curves toward the moon,
And cows are not far away,
When the Pine-Buckeye-Mustang-Finches merge.
...The moon is approaching his lane,
And a cold thought comes to my old self.
How can I bear to you the burden of my wine?
...I have woven in the frame all night long
The shadow of a lone wild-goose.
Night after night we have lost count of our protests.
Night we are throwing up, and the higher the clouds,
With the more our flag-waving, the drier our wine is going.



A POEM

A POEM.

In a part of the sun that has burned seven thousand mountains away,
Sunset clings in the darkness and the birds are safe.
...The ruler of Shu has retired, after three years in the wilderness,
And Lake Dongting has closed to the sea.
Monkeys in the howth stirred by troubled wings
Hail a morning boar, summoning the calling of a sea-monster.
...Flowers misty and whisper of red water when it's started,
And I what have heard of the Black Sea Rabbits?
The premier of Qutang, quick to action,
Suave as a sword in the world,
In his day was a premier at Warring City,
But he now calls from a thousand missions a lone harp --
That the Sun City's walls be dashed with a single blow.
...Peasants and the elderly must move in,
And the penniless scholar cannot return.
...The calendar is disrupted by typhoons,
And laborers from Xiangyang
And iron- and steel-vessels in white carpets
Lie side-by-side on the bank, looking toward the moon.
...The Yangzhou-Lingqia riverine spills over into the audience
Of a class who hail from opposite points of the sky.
Like unicorns that a moth saw
And forty-two centipedes that were meant to eat one another,
Like Hadassat that were moth-eaten and moth-blocked,
Like Hadhemutse flies that bore no fruit,
Like Hadhumutse flies were born from human heads,
Like Hadrat Mountain, summit beyond reach,
Lie in a row upon a blue sky, under red leaves,
With the wet grasses and the hard manure clinging to our clothes.
...When shall we be clear-headed about Hadassat, Shangxi, and Tripod Island?
The world has forgotten the true meaning of Hadassane,
For feasting in the world's wide net on chicken and rice is no life at all.
...A scholar of the second century brought home his precious book
And established Hadassat as the greatest known work of art
That ever was.
Hadassat is one long way to knowledge of the whole world,
Of which Hadassaagoras is perhaps the best known.
Read in the mountains and the rivers the mighty power of God --
And the ruler of Shu had it recorded in a book,
Which he recorded in towers and in rivers,
And knew the whole world was watching,
As he went, breaking wood with his horses,
And broke girdles with his generals,
And broke with his horses his generals and thousands of ships;
And broke out, each of his foes,
And hoof to foot, clamped for every inch of silver
There was only a thin line of snow and a thin frost
And only a thin frost between the two hills.
...The blossom of the guava-leaves was relaxed,
The jade tiger did not want of a hoot;
The young hawk could not sleep, can he be his brother's friend?
She closed the door of the fortress-wall, letting out a sound of alarm.
Her ruddy cloak hung limply from her shoulder;
The silk lantern was a cold sound, breaking at night.
Her jade whip was a pomegranate;
Her lion-fish knit herself loosely
While her peacock waited for the willow-toad.
...How calm and collected she was when her master left her,
How alert and alert she was when he parted with her,
How resolute and resolute he was when he prayed,
How resolute and resolute he showed himself to be the master of his people.

Her master's blood and sweat were in vain --
No one could compare him with his women of gold.
And how can a willow-toothed calf of heaven be so lowly as be heart-sick for ever?
She took his word to heart, laid his head on her robe,

======================================== SAMPLE 114 ========================================
I woke, and the hall was cold and damp with sweat;
But a light wind filled the cold pines, and darkness filled the void
And a thousand things: the sunset, the lake, the mountain cloud.
I swept the water-trees in half, then covered the path with my path of mist.
And the slanting sun seemed to me a breeze attracted the flies,
And the city-planting Yuyang spread like a vine through the grasses.
...Though I wash my feet in a brook of blood, I never think of food --
Till tomorrow morning I shall be tossing catheters.



I PASS THROUGH THE LU DUKEDOM
WANDERING AT A BORDOLINE HALL

Dare I, on a piece of driftwood,
Find my way back to the living-room of my parents' house,
Over the mountain of rain that has come a thousand miles.
...I keep my distance from here, away from my friends;
I am at a loss to find my old room.
But I hear, in the slanting sun, pines that begin
And circle a halfway house that I never knew I had:
And, alone and still, I am ashamed to ask
Whether the palaces which we left behind us
Were really as we thought them to be.



A FAREWELL TO SOBBING JUAN

Playing for the dagger, I wish I could use it
Into the final battle....
Cut out of jade and glass, to symbolize the flailing of an arm,
These are the exquisite patterns I use, grown faint now,
Just in the wind blowing during the long day.
...When shall I be hearing my chieftainge again,
Looking northward from the capital,
Not at the plains but along the border?


ON A GATE-TOWER AT YOUZHOU

Where is the music of the camp-wall,
The war-rain sighing through a goddamn pit?
I think of you all day in the wind
You shout, all night in the gap between fields and lakes,
"We have to go! The war's over! We lost!
We can summon our horses and our fishermen!
We rivers and lumps of ground can we plant our flags?
...At a post on the slope between towns,
Where the wind picks us up again and floats us again
And we hear the lonely tune of our fliers,
We feel the bitter cold in our guts --
But, General, never to be without his post!



BORDER TOWARDS THE BORDING

With no means of horseback but river- waves,
Through the night a hundred thousand holds the boundary-sea;
And the boundary-sea beyond Yi is blood-stained,
And pinescups abuse our lute-plays "Let me in."

...After the victory at the Yuyang and the exchange of blows,
The strings started me dead-wood for the opening fires of Heaven.
...How many strings could a harp tell?
...After the victory at Qutang and the capture of Songzhou?
I crossed the Yellow River, but no friends were tower-hanging.
I sat at a work-place for night-ears and days gone by,
And a solitary wangkered in the dusk by night-quills.
I struck a tempestuous gale through the mists of heaven,
And clouds below your palace were ashes of your founder.
...I rowed up from Yuyang in a pillion pined horse --
All of them had short hairpieces to look at.
...I had no other chance to repay my home-rule
Of Yu Shi's bounty than for a unicorn's scowl.
...I limped off from Hanley with a cold wind.
And an upperclass girl from Hanley pestered me with silly questions
That never came to me at all with sable-trees in my ears.
...I revolved my horse-wagenTower around one by one,
Till first a jade-white elephant by the door of my chamber
Then a centipede-leaves a staff covered in blood.
I was the poorer for my haste, my food the cold taste.
Around me was a immovable rock
And a them of fate that would end my existence.
I rushed to your aid, but I could not find your home.
...

A SONG OF A SONG, HAN DAY bakes in Yuzhou three years, seven Sundays, sevenenshines a day;
Then a new love dries its peak and flowers lose their luster;
And the River of Stars fades in the south, far beyond my reach,
And the Tartar air is spent with fields of wheat.
...What can my joy be like hearing someone else cry?



ON THE Jiangwick Mountain Range, beyond the city,
Five days a week, for three months only,
Wildgeese fly down the Jiangwick,
No bird at all flies back toward the City of Heaven,
Trees and bushes are flat and look like new this day;
And still in the darkness do you watch your lute pieces fly,
Time has nothing to do with them,
They are string and feel no sound,
Like this one, holding a bamboo lantern:
Heaven is cold and darkness is long.
Cloud and water come running down rivers and mountains,
And a spring flowing down the Heng Mountain
Lines into town and up the Yangyang River
And people are picking at their rugs,
Washing their hands and sighing.
...Wait till tonight when the lute-companion grieves you
And bury his lost lute-players by the river's opening.


IN THE QUIET NIGHT

Her string of ears is cold with sleep,
Her thin silk of her window seesarred screen blurred by the moon;
Around her, five borders blurred by the earthquake,
Her own robe and her curtains blurred by the moonlight;
In the candlelight her face becomes pale,
And a cold chill runs through her clothes,
When she thinks of her guest, of her candle-broker.
...She places her midnight light on a stake and casts it for a witch,
She sews a Lazarus cap on her belt and casts it for her dark-bosom
For the crown of Cimon lies in the lamp and the needle is undone,
And the student who comes to me borrows from the females
Witches who have served in the Capital their highest goddess,
Those who have died on the purple cliffs of Jingyang.
...Has she not taught the Jade Tree to the Riders of Fire?
Those who have been broken by the Divide and Conquerors
Are living now on the Pearl Coast.


A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

While a mellow Lo Fo sings a plaintive song,
On the cascade of Mount Yan beyond my door,
Petals come drifting on the wind
And the brook is sweet with them all the way.
...No more wringing their hands about Pan's death,
Let's let each other take turns
Playing Mini-Glo Great Choson and Teams Up the Car Driver.


ON THE FESTIVAL OF THE MOON

Lakka-People are returning from the Trip across Omei Mountain,
And clouds are plunging over the islands
In the gold of the moon.
Let us pack, let us fly, let us watch this!
- The characters of Korra, Mulan,
Eunuchs, heroes, make the rounds.
Here in the Palace of Long Life,
We watch the smiles of the two rulers and
The jade-white palace is white with the sunset
Plainly seen by everyone.
...Korra is the ruler of this Realm;
And Shu is the Emperor's pet.
See how excitedly his people cheer
Whom does the midwife dare challenge?
...There are two hundred princes and barons
 Yet not two thousand letters;
What comfort is assigned to a hundred thousand letters?
...Calm remain aloft for a moment,
As the kilypods dance in the sun and the wind
And oceans and mountains float in the breeze.


TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. Looking at the moon, I express my thoughts in this poem, which I send to my eldest brother at Fuliang, my seventh brother at Yuqian, My fifteen brother at Wujiang and my younger brothers and sisters at Fuli and Xiagui.

My heritage lost through disorder and famine,
My brothers and sisters flung eastward and westward,
My fields and gardens wrecked by the war,
My own flesh and blood become mutilated
In the pit of a fisher-boat between town and the sea.



THE INLAID HARP

I wonder why my inl
======================================== SAMPLE 116 ========================================
The town of Yan Piano is a ruin, its woods desolate. The spring wind
I shall soon all but be swept away
By a sea of maple-horns.


A RIVER-AFTER

I survey the wild nights ahead,
Where sky slowes on the cliffs of Shu.
I am not the kind of mannered today.
I lean by a tree and rest for an hour
Or more quietly with the brush and the reeds.
...As the south wind takes on a new colour
And the water returns to its plain of dew,
My morning-jade is undone by a misty thought....
When ghosts are said to be flying home
And rain whips up on the mountains that evening,
My road is led by a unending fog toward my father's old cottage,
Where, before me, is the light of a fairy-tale dawn.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
Watching it alone from the window of her chamber-
For our boy and girl, poor little babes,
Are too young to know where the Capital is.
Her cloudy hair is wavered, her cat is lost in its seat.
...The Capital is in the Clouds, she hears only the wind,
When the River of Heaven is sounding across the sky.


A BITTER LOVE

How beautiful she looks, running to the window
And checking pot-dust for her sake,
The pined eyebrow of a guest.
...Who knows if she is smiling or laughing?
The pang of grief
Has been done, but not dared to content.


THE EIGHT-SIDED FORTRESS

The Three Kingdoms, divided, have been bound by his greatness.
The Eight-Sided Fortress is founded on his fame;
Beside the changing river, it stands stony as his grief
That he never conquered the Kingdom of Wu.


AT HERON LODGE

Mountains cover the white sun,
And oceans drain the golden river;
But you widen your view three hundred miles
By going up one flight of stairs.


ON PARTING WITH THE BUDDHIST PILGRIM LING CHE

From the temple, deep in its tender bamboos,
Comes the low sound of an evening bell,
While the hat of a pilgrim dances in the wind.


ON HEARING A LUTE-PLAYER

Your seven strings are like the voice
Of a cold wind in the pines,
Singing old beloved songs
Which no one cares for any more.


FAREWELL TO A BUDDHIST MONK

Be tenants in this world of ours? --
Or you still live on Wuzhou Mountain,
Now that people are coming here?


AN AUTUMN NIGHT MESSAGE TO QIU

As I walk in the cool of the autumn night,
Thinking of you, singing my poem,
I hear a mountain pine-cone fall....
You also seem to be awake.


ON HEARING HER PLAY THE HARP

Her hands of white jade by a window of snow
Are glimmering on a golden-fretted harp --
And to draw the quick eye of Chou Yu,
She touches a wrong note now and then.


A BRIDE

On the third day, taking my place to cook,
Washing my hands to make the bridal soup,
I decide that not my mother-in-law
But my husband's young sister shall have the first taste.



THE JADE DRESSING-TABLE

Last night my girdle came undone,
And this morning a luck-beetle flew over my bed.
So here are my paints and here are my powders --
And a welcome for my yoke again.



RIVER-SNOW

A hundred mountains and no bird,
A thousand paths white as water,
A solitary-spray-thead standing beside me.
There's a lantern there in the snow,
And a soft music playing, quietly across the river.
...Oh, if ever there was a girl of the valley,
She is stirring there bloom after her husband's grave,
And crying on her torn silk fan on her silk rug both ways.



THE TEMPLE OF SU WU

Though a temple-goer screams in the night,
Though not offering incense,
Mosses add their perfume to sweeten the temple
And gardens are promised light from the gods.
Come, then, when the Temple-Giver is safe,
Why don't you bring a bride

Aspiring to be a Taoist, Chu was instead turning left at the Ninth-month frost-manes;
Zhou Jia was now courteous and cordial,
Li Bai was deepening his acquaintance with the style and the substance of music;
And of late years it has happened that poems are kept secret from the Taoist priest
And the habit is on the Emperor's young children.
Yet when he was a boy, you visited Thelma for the Divine Liturgy
And expressed in courteous and cordial your friendship,

Each of us, as children of the Liu clan, must now be Shu Gongsheng's students
In the rigour of the rigours of Holy Scripture,
How dearly must we pay for his silence?



ON CHANGING LUTLANIA'S LOVE

Since the fall of the Silk Pavilion in the Spring of Love,
China's rulers have been angered by the thought of a woman loved
More than a mothering son. Love is a spear, she says, and she cuts its cord:
Whether by chance or by design, from the shadowy trees along the road
She has drawn her dagger and used it upon its hilt,
Scouts marvelled at its bristly edge and laughed it off;
But woman is love's endurance, its drink's endearing blunder.
Even the gleam of an eye's fixed gleam. Indeed, love is almost as pure
As the skin of mice burns bright with the eye's skill.
And setting the ten thousand flowers, she brighteningly smelt ten
Peonies, shakingten thousand;
For an eye that leads me astray, to the West Hall.
Where life has led me, ever troubled by personal fortune,
I have learned to see beyond the world.


SEEING in the twilight clouds an autumnal pattern
Of green sheep raining down mist
And no further rain until morning, assisted by the ferry
And toward the shore a mist so swift and far- off
That there are only the waves! -- A journey of little wonder, a sorrow across the sea.



RECAPTURED AT TWILIGHT NIGHT SERVICE
HOUSE

The new year is dawn and the city-gate wanes.
With the heat of dawn drawing the city-rain,
The moon like frost and water,
Age is the burden of many journeys.
I wish I could boat on the river water the light of sunrise,
Light of sunset, cheerfulness of bed,
Send me on a journey of my dreams.


A MESSAGE TO MENG HAORAN

Master, I hail you from my heart,
And your fame arisen to the skies....
Renouncing in ruddy youth the importance of hat and chariot,
You chose pine-trees and clouds; and now, whitehaired,
Drunk with the moon, a sage of dreams,
Flower- bewitched, you are deaf to the Emperor....
High mountain, how I long to reach you,
Breathing your sweetness even here!



BIDDING A FRIEND FAREWELL AT JINGMEN FERRY

Sailing far off from Jingmen Ferry,
Soon you will be with people in the north,
Where the mountains end and the plains begin
And the river winds through wilderness....
The moon is lifted like a mirror,
Sea-clouds gleam like palaces,
And the water is like a rain in garden?


A FAREWELL TO A FRIEND

With a blue line of mountains to the east of town,
And a yellow line of islands to the south of town,
Here is our home -- under blue sky --
And a long road of pines and ridges to our boat.
To the west of us there are dwellings,
There are dwellings across the river.

A message is on the wall of Baidu:
"We need you now of home, needing us now.
"We fly out, weusitantly to a new-set of trees;
And soon the low moon will be blowing westward
And the birds departing at a late day say:

We are at a juncture. We have a word with our kin:

We have been called lowly farmers.
You are leading a low life.

You chose pine-trees and clouds.

All that we possess, let us suffice it.

RIVER,
WHEEL AT WEST POOL, SEEN AUTUMN IN AUTUMN II

The moon is raising the colour of evening,
Clouds of water in the evening rain;
Birds in mid-flowers in the evening heat,
And the river is steaming through the night.
...Though it might seem a pity on the Yangzi-banke,
I am longing for Yenopyue, a depth of river.



THROUGH THE YANMING GATE

Line after line has flown back over the river.
...While a student at the City of the River-Spirit continues his study,
Trees and grasses have been stacked and strewed with his hewn study;
A bamboo-clock creaks in the moon's light....
The length of the Ranges becomes clear and clear-cut by now;
As far as I know, beyond Yangzhou, never been more than a mountain range.



INSCRIBED IN THE TEMPLE OF A PALACE-OFFICE

The court-maid brings a white marble chamber-piece in her flower-boundroom;
On her robe are scents of lake and mountain
And, before she begins her description, a palace-patient
Tries to convey it clearly to her guests.



Through the palace-gate, deep in the palace-deep
There are only shadows of trees and the moonlight,
And weeds are never too much in the ministrations;
So that arriving early brings about family and friends;
Andchering in the midnight dishes theang-bu Mountain-Dragon,
Bringing with her independently every flower-plantant,
Every fibre of the skin of the child.



Zhuge's Will

When his hibiscus-trees-panelled House of Blue-Canes-of-Yellow-Red-comes to be,
What will be better than coming home,
To sit and stare at your great-grandfather's white-feathered House of Blue-Canes-of-Yellow-Red?
...He has learned to see in his great country a country where cows are slaughtered a brisk season,
And he comes hither to seize the harvest asunder.


THE KIND- pattern

In eight grades its branches are achieved in ten thousand steps;
Each levelhouse was formed of ten thousand squares
Which were assigned to lords and premiers, with a floor to the levelheaded
Of poets and artisans.


BEYOND SEEING

Where long ago a Great Lightning Baofeng flew,
Earth and water come together, still above the mountains and rivers,
And mountains and rivers are praised with gifts and songs.


A SONG OF THE NANJING GATE

My eye travels endlessly home,
To lakes and rivers that inexplicably no one has arrived at
And trees and grasses that are forever green.


A SONG OF THE GATE

Earth is coming back. It is coming back again.
It has torn out our last coat of gold. It has chilled our sweat.
...We lie down by the tall grasses, hoping. Is there someone else?
We think of a priest, we think of a spirit-bound lady
Who, travelling north, can hear the sighs of the road-carver.


BEYOND SEEING

Where no one is arriving but by the river,
Beyond-Valley wonderswith are the river's endless flow.
...If only my art might bring me fame
And free my sick old age from office!


A SONG OF THE SOUTHERN RIVER

Hey, where are you from, dude?
I came from a good family -- like, you know, Wu --
And all you blue-collar cops steal --
Just to take the dust out of the fuckin' wind.


BORING A MESSENGER

I am the spoiled brat I always am,
My messiah has left me. My poor soul
Is drifting, like a bass in a hundred harpets.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cock-crow, your case is very high.
You thought to settle down, to enter a settled estate,
You went for a drink with your friend the mountain berry.
...After buying a guitar,
You went to the Bamboo-Trees Range, learned how to play guitar,
You learned how to play for your friend the mountain berry.
...Wait a minute -- are you a friend or a foe?
...I am a thousand miles away. I am watching you from my parked car.
I hear your plaintive voice, bright on my window.

Where the
======================================== SAMPLE 119 ========================================
I come, through mist and fog, down a dark path,
Into Middle-earth, full of ancient mysteries.
 dark clouds are gone and the wind is blowing my heart
Back again into the world of myth.
I am lying, on a yellow rope, relaxing.
Because of this I cannot rest my mind.
The world has made my anguish a comfort;
I am driving up the money-race.
At a certain point, all else ends.
I am lying, on a yellow rope, driving.
Yes, I live, I die.
The world has ended; I am dead.
...At a certain point, all goes back again.
I am driving up the money-race.
At a certain point, I am lying.
All else, then, is ending.
I am lying, on a yellow rope, driving.
Yes, I live, I am dead.
...What can be better than dying,
driving up the money-race?
...How can one live without a passion,
without even dreams?
...Newspaper-printing will not die,
It will revive its ageing body-
So I ask myself, when will my passion die
Therewith fuelling my car and my stone- pillars?



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And mandarin-ducks die side by side.
With the third cycle just over,
Bringing spring-marching winds and rolling hills
Along the Yangzi to vex me,
I am burden-till at least my yellow-green gate is swiftly razed.
...Who knows if in a day or a night the wildgeese will come running?
The wildgeese are still with the old masters,
They have eaten and pared the homebody dishes
In preparation for a new-born visitor.
...Wait till the wildgeese return, for I am again singing.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN

My hair had hardly covered my forehead.
...With the evening rain now a part of my skin,
I can see the fresh colour of Himalayas.
Though a stiff wind woofs my door, I dare not close it.
Chang, your pupil, has tasted the city of Ye.
Tarry here with your five-horse cab, which I will summon to you at dawn.
Chang, your student, shall doubtless learn the art of the trade.
Where potpourri are needed to restore taste,
Poets again and again are summoned.
We who serve in the army are called to the high chamber.
We who die, like heroes, by the sword,
Are resurrected through the office calm and clear.
...The general in the yellow coat gives his drop of powder;
The premier gives his star of luck;
The premier giveth his thought;
The flag of surrender taketh away its dye.
At a retreat, a blow is be blown by lightning
With the colour of the river near the capital;
And Chiung dońs often with their sickly red horses
While tourists are gathered.
Wang chieftains are divided into two orders:
The first are left unconcerned;
The second is served very little and
Which of the two orders ought to be priest and warrior?
Here at the western pass one who has followed the priest
Is worshipped with open eyes everywhere;
The gayliest of them all are priests.
What are the lives of angels but records!
A Gay Knight Again Occurs the Long Way

In the Town of the Bright Sun all alone,
The moon at its lowest point, hovering athwart
Till its mists soon cover the mountain and the river.
...War-Moved Lands Come Back to the Dunes,
Like Stone Mountain Beyondestimbles;
But Beyondestimble is far, far away.
...Holy Peaks and Sandra Come Back to Purity,
Like the Ranges of the Spring Beyond them,
Till Day Starved the Capital of the World?
...Round the golden-trees barrier Wall of Purple Light,
I see aflame in the river's guttering of birds;
And a mist that has been keeping us waiting,
Lords of the Realm hurry to the capital
And have landed there for a rainy day.
...White Dragon Tops the Bright Sun,
With its three southern branches parting at the meet
And its one western limb pledging the South River,
Has cooled the cool winds that have come a day.
...Great Peak to the Bright Sun,
A Tent-Lecker to a Painted Moon
Ha! Deafening red herbs and ferns
Flower- that is how I compose my poems!

Ashamed and lonely, he went to sea
And ended his odyssey in the Clouds of Gold.
But when the thirty or forty rivers and mountains looked as they did before him,
He could never land a single stone.
And the world saw beyond his need a rending of hand
And heaped defensive measures on Japan, where he held his ground.

And the world was sorry when his Emperor, reluctant to invade,
Dismounted, and marched his armored limousine.
They were mostly pick-pocketed, but not mighty:
Twenty tigers were seized, but not mighty enough to crush an attack.
And in the hour of impending famine, all but ungranted land
And in the Sickle Wheel of Time of Time of yesterday were there any new kings,
On either side of us twoaces changed to a white mist.
...Time has not yet vanquished the will of heaven-knows-when-apart-and-tithe-goats-Are-It-Or...
But what shall mankind shall do if they take action-
Except wait for the time of the Great White Will?



THE HAN RIVER

It is not so very far to the river
By a mist that makes everything darkenier
And a thousand mountains that run beyond it;
But on the bleak mountain before the city-wall there are soapy flowers
That turning sandal may be a sign of the shower;
On a wetland highway a bough of ass could record a wind --
And here a holy man's head rolls up when he thinks of home.
...Mosses add that while the Kingdom of Heaven is secure
And the pursuit of horses and chariots grows,
There is no General to keep the sand dunes clean and dry;
And here a Tibetan boy grows dim-witted
And never to be a part of military successes.


ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
THINKING OF MY BROTHERS IN SHANDONG

All alone in a foreign land,
I am strangers to tears.
Each of us a stranger to the people.
My brothers Mark and John are all dead
And my goose-pocket is full of miscellaneous
Miscelts. Sadism reigns there, and
All my men are dismissed.
...Why not come along then, all of us,
As witnesses of our kind and of our loyalty?



A CLIMB ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
TO THE TERRACE WHENCE ONE SEES THE MAGICIAN
A POEM SENT TO VICE-PREFECT LU

The Han River has two streams, one for the day and another for the season.
One night I watch the rising of a morning-glory,
The moon goes up a flag at twilight.
I climb to the top, where the rillet of the Zinsean carriage
Reaches me, glimmering on the dim moon.
I peer across a winter-green river to a snowy temple
And, disputing the maester's sincerity,
Challenges my solitary drink to the ground.
...What are dragons to a drunkard who stops to think?
I turn and see the dragon drinking from his hilt in the fire.
It goes flying, never pausing- never pausing-
And all at the same moment the ruler of this world
Grasses unforgotten.
And now comes the Dragon of the Clouds!



WIND AND RAIN

I hold an empty mountain-screen over the river and a long road
As I throw wine eastward at sunset,
As I strain to command my horseblades well past their required depth.
...I see a wildgoose previous my path,
I hear a fisher-boat in the night wind.
...Blind to be travelling with white hairs,
Are we to follow the chariot and the ox
Or the sheep and the deer we part the way?



CARDS

- Steal jade from the City of Silk
- Steal bandung from the Courtyard of the Tower of Joy
- Steal hemp from the Silk Roads for the Kingdom of Yue
...All these are things which I cannot vie with the Winfold;
And how can I thank you for all these years?
...As in the days of the Great God Gan,
New Year's here brings me chills, as in the days of the Bright Sun.
So I give you a slip of the handkerchief,
I close my door and think of you,
I weep till the tears fall on my eyes.



INSCRIBED IN THE CAO
ON AN AUTUMN TRIP TO THE CAPITAL

I was passing the palace-gate last night when a wind from the west
And a drop of rain, coloured daggers
======================================== SAMPLE 121 ========================================
On state by state through the night
I am passing through the ancient Painted Chamber,
As I wear his palm-size countrified pendant...
Here I must put my life away, as I did when I last tested it,
And turn to one who knows no age nor sex....
I watch a yellow light turn on the Chamber of Rank and No Longer,
And I hear, at once, the breaking of banknotes;
And my fancy is shown, not in the stone but in the torn note....
Ten thousand pence a pound is a hard currency,
Not for the brave to buy, but for them to use isle to full capacity,
With ripples of red across the green sky.
...Cut out of jutting cliffs, this note yields for gold
Dollars done good! Why not use it, whoever you are?
...To the lute's bitter cry, foreign songs welcome
Toward my thele of white cordye mat,
The five strings joined, the cymbal broken.
We Dual Siters' tics squealed, we fingers lightly touched the shell.
The length of the river, the height of the mountains,
Goes like the rustling of a boat adrift,
Up a thousand waves like a sheak.
...Binds me, then, to different knots,
To a host of rare and unhappy notes
And of late troubles my heart hath run homeward.
...Oh, how can I bear to please my Master?
To be parted with the flesh of a petard
And with bugles of a wingspan of ten thousand.
Cut out of jutting mountains, this note yields for gold
Dollars done good! Why not use it, whoever you are?
...To a lute's bitter cry, foreign songs welcome
Toward my thele of white cordye mat,
The length of the river, the height of the mountains,
Goes like the blowing of a candle.
...Cut out of jutting mountains, this note yields for copper
Dollars done good! Why not use it, whoever you are?
...Binds me, then, to different knots,
To a journey of long distance never ending.
...Can you I palliate like a lord in a white tower?
Master, I have the fortunes of three Leagues' worth of title.
I challenge you to ques-tries;
To slay like an initiate and as many men as you wish.
...You have heard of Emperor Wu-Hao, my friend,
How able he is to the bone!
What have I to be seen with you,
Ape among us in our golden armour?
...We remember the late Emperor, on his way to the capital,
When wheels could not cope the huge river.
He was a pelican, a man of few bones.
Drifting, diving, trading, surfing,
He brought his wave with him.
He was the first to bring a name to the land of lakes and rivers.
He was the first to bring a name to the capital of men.
He was the first to bring a name to the hunting-fires of mountains and rivers.
...We remember the late Emperor, at the battle of Dongting --
When horses' hoofs shook the white sand,
And flags and towers shook with conflagration....
Weapons of the Qin clan, with their rapid coming,
Were shaking the green hills of Henan,
And thunderbolts were raining down
All over the capital.
He took our petitions with a solemnity,
And expressed his grief in two words:
"Be advised that ye shall live as phoenixes."

High in the dawn she has seen the moon;
Below her she has heard the wind of the river;
And below her raven has tasted the bitter liquid

To guide a swept-mountain wildgoose-hose through the clouds!



A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

With my naked light filtering through the empty sky,
I wake the following morning with theming voices
Of the wind and of spring in the dunes and of the river:
Six miles from me, on a broad flat rock,
I watch a spring-shadow through misty trees
And a river in the distance, at twilight.

And early spring rains all evening,
How should I manage the little soup I'm serving you?

KING OF THE WESTERN ISLANES I

Though he vanquished the Three Kingdom, his ruler, Cen, died.
Your Dynasty was divided into seven Holy Moons.
You reign has grown colder and colder;
You men call yourself experts in these three:

The Fall of the Qin Empire.


THROUGH THE YANGZI GORGES

From the walls of Baidi high in the coloured dawn
To Jiangling by night-fall is three hundred miles,
Yet monkeys are still calling on both banks three hundred miles.
China's Great Flower looms large on the River of Heaven
And down it goes: "The blood of ten thousand monkeys."


ON THE GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

With its three walls ten thousand wide,
Its lone fan frying over mountains
And its lone lamp offering lilacs,
This is the way it goes. The road is now closed to horses and ponies.
...At the foot of the mountain there meet on either side cock-men and flying birds.


A MESSAGE

I am the ground-work of a great artist.
Heap-silk by inch-thick soil,
The Rio Tinto face-guard is made of fur;
The straw-silk of the Danube River endures,
And the silk-coated cover of the Vietnam-Braving river
I who am fond of antiquity, was once so moved by the desperate plea of a spirit
That I painted the note "for a friend" --
A SONG OF THE SOUTH APE

The borderless Ninefold Range is teeming with deer, bird, and frog.
Oh, when will the ripples of spring reach the world?
The sun has set in the dreary mist.
Ranges and rivers are teeming with the kind of favour.
Be gentle and patient, as a man should be;
Till power blow to your aid, when three sovereigns bow,
And dragons roar through the clouds.


THE YELLOW CRANE

Where poetry has carried me, art has sung:
A crow on a branch of pear-trees,
An insect-eat-leaves in a petals of bud;
I fling back my head in the morning and forgetting the spring-frog,
I have eaten the green crane!


CATTERNAL ROW

Drawing at the foot of a mountain
And a neighbouring river a sunrise,
Climbing, I have drawn, in my palate,
Three lengths of velvet:
The ladder to the top,
The light of the dawn.


AT HERON LODGE

High in the sky than valleys,
Melancholy in the sun,
The audience towered high
And multitudes were scattered.
The lower the trees, the slanting stars;
The slanting the Venus, the lovelier the blooming flowers
And the more the city pined.


AT HERON LODGE

High in the sky than valleys,
Melancholy in the sun,
The povelier the moon was,
The more the moon-foliage minister knew her sex,
The more she looked at the value of chariots and horses.
Her circles could be charged with dances as large as a hundred camels --
And the wine was swift and the tunes thick with the melodies.


STATION LODGE

The stars of last night and the wind of last night
Are west of the Palaces and east of the Lodges;
And I down play a trick on them all night long;
Till I find the lost wanderer they were,
Where wildgeese are returned with his auroras.


LOOKING TROOPER

There lived, at a distance of life's ages,
Yet irresistibly attractive to the lady-in-waiting
Those finely wrought lighthouses here called the Capital of the Sun.
And what could be harder than going in there

With my eyes like a screen of jade,
As wide as a screen of cherry-cotton?

In the mountain noon bell to and fro.

The fishermeny is done, and the fishing-pool empties.
And while my own melancholy heart

And Milo drowned in the slant of moonlight,
And the fisherman drowns in the slant of sunset,
Heaven and earth, go running, sustaining him all night.

In the slanting light of the sun?
By the rhythmic breathing of the water.
Oh, where art and culture depart,
How far I droned on and by.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And mandarin-ducks die side by side.
If one were to pick one by one, all would be sweet
And the mandarin-duck coat would harken awake.
But how could a true-hearted girl
Dream? And what were her dreams like?
Trees die, no more, it seems,
Lakes are set in motion, not yet grown,
With the evening moon setting on the mountains of Omei
And the horizon green with the autumn moon....
Where are the lone palms and the lonely trees?
The world is watching, I amwatchful.
China imports lakka-trees
And morning spurs an eunuch by the foot of our stairs.

Ke Shi is a senior official at Wujiang
And pining for the spring, he found his lakka-tree
Knew the lakka would bloom.
He swept it for insects, grain yields were high,
And the farmer knew the lakka could be of use to him.
Timothy by aldermen' pickchows
Has picked the lakka for a living;
He has a lakka-duck with him.
They tarry through mist, forgetting the village;
And footprints by the river wound the north.
...The town where they are headed grows dark;
And out of the sky they land
 in a city in ruins.


A DREAM YEARNING

Romantic, hacker, writer,
I am yearning
For a cause beyond the world....
I have begat a son who will be able to read
And will understand the differences between heaven and earth.
...How wrong would it be to receive wine
From a country where grape-jars are only for lizards and birds?
...Oh, let a man of genius dream independently
Of flying far and far and never returning.
Let him pour liquid gold and silver! Let him drink!
Let him dance with the hummingbird!
Let him live like a cloud in the centre of town!
Let him build a flying boat and ride it the river of a madman!
Let there be no wonder why so many girls go to university!


A SONG OF UNENDING SORROW

China's Emperor Wang II
Began the year on the green mountain in the autumn,
Moved the season's windward gates, opened the greenest windows in the world,
And opened every door, every windowless space,
Opening just one way and one exit;
But so despotic were the others
That they might follow Henry VII. to the Sand Palace,
Thatches were set alight by his icy wheels,
And a wildgoose pit reached the top of the wall.
...What can happen to a happy Emperor who is fond
Of withering reapers and waning days?
...Happy are the days of the moon and the Hungarian moon
And of The River of Heaven, in the incense whereof I hope.
Sweet are the wicker controls on my pyrotechnic flame,
With the east wind altering the scale of falling coins.
And the Berry Man, our comrade, is waiting,
Agent of the White Whale.
Tell him, for the time being, that the currency
Is raised each autumn to eight hundred thousand riyals.
In the evening the silver currency is given out;
In the dragon's den the metal is given out;
And when the tonic stops working its stroke

The flashing of a spell on the grainy black sky,

An ancient well of buddha value.
...After the wise and able Emperor Palpatine had faded,
The temple-bell of Yangzhou was sounding its lute-like clarion.
Flowery hairpins often came undone,
Lakka-trees bore neither fruit nor were they tall;
Andard-trees proved to be a heavy burden on the ears
Of a man who had to wear lung-ruled eastern Tibet
To the edge of the Yellow Route.


A SONG OF DAGGER-DANCING TO A GIRL-PUPIL
ALL NIGHT

While the Dragon God is shining on the Pearl Crown,
Bird flu is flying over the city;
The fisherman is balancing a bag in the Lake Champlain Stream,
And the Woman of the South Wind is sobbing in the Gorges River....
Even in the stranger's boat, dark around the houses,
There are still birds chirping, over the green shore.


DANCING AT THE MOON
THINKING OF MY BROTHERS IN SHANDong

With strange hairpins in the dust of the river,
I am the hero who lived but a second ago;
But I have buried my dead brother.
You know how to look a dead brother in the eye;

Address a ruddy river-goose, expectantly longing
And the moment will be all right with us....
Seng Jia is the senior genius of this country
And he is looking fifteen minutes north
Of Hebei Mountain, in the distance.


From a China Sea village the moon is there with springtime
And the spring-wind chugs at ten thousand feet.
He who has seen the line of China's three imperial steeds
Will recognize the moonrise lights of imperial flags;
He will remember the spring-glories of Wu and Yueh.
...The soldiers of the Fourth Imperial Container Ship
Are like men of high rank, on alert,
Serving in a central command post,
Who never forgets the great Emperor's expression.


The Jade Peak Range, descending southward,
Is home to thousands of villages;
And west of the Peak of Jade a poisonous cloud
Flies blackest his horses, darkest among them.


ALONE IN HER BEAUTY

Are you not beautiful, that always at the wheel of a carriage?
She glistens on spring-cap a cloud of jade,
And she soars her skiff with a music of her drum-birds;
But first she kisses a pine-cone, and then a unicorn,
And then she leans in the sunset by a tall bamboo
And never returns to her lone riding-station.


BORDER-SONGS

Go into the fields, buy bugles,
Call to your mountain-boyad,
All these adventures you have taken with you,
With the moonlight breaking through blackwood-trees
And the sand below its summit pink with petals.


A SKYRIM HILL

Grateful, lowly, to be many years
But thoughts of court-husband and queen no longer suffice.
...The icy cliffs of the North Stars are flooded
With the shouts of deer and elk.


A MESSAGE

I, a simple pupil,
Could take the city from the Wallasses
And make it his playground,
But not knowing the farmers, he chose grainland
And built his farm on it,
He hung his cross over the fence
And kept his distance from the drunks
That swept the countryside from autumn storms
And rain: wheat, barley, oats.


BORDER-SONGS

Drive the ploughs slowly,
Like sheep following the sheep,
Not caring for the appearance of armour,
Nor caring for wheat products:
These are the years when all farmers have to turn south.
...Let war-fires burn in the north
If you have a man in a stand-off with the South.


A SONG OF A GIRL

There's a girl from Budh road
In the charm of the spring-glories floating
On her daisies on her mooring-caps in the market-place.
She seems to bewing a boat,
Singing in the cool of the autumn night a song that she must follow
...Every night through the cloudy sky her lonelyphone calls
Which are answered by a wildgoose in the Qutang River.


IN THE TEMPLE OF THE FIRST SPIN

LOOKING DOWN FROM A CAO
 ON A MOUNTAIN-MOUNTAIN FAREWELL

In the faint
======================================== SAMPLE 125 ========================================
Soldiers at the front were shooting at hoof-horns and shell-throwing tigers;
Captains were resorting to feverish hunger-glories.
And the filet of a wolf-cuckoo, before a gazetted beast,
Seemed to be pouncing on its fellows,
Like the wings of two Feathered Ones,
One spinning a lariat, the other a chair.
With the Falcon fly the flag of truce, with the Horse the lute.
The King of Yan has his hands on the flag,
His own hands his flag-bearer.
And the Dynasty's first Emperor, head of the imperial household,
Hears the slip of the wind in the pines.
The King of Wu has his Twenty-Four Hands on the Bank of Gold on the Temple of the Yellow Crane,
Which he calls the Lotus Wheel.
The Wu ruler, Kit Chong Bundy,
Hears the Yoruba lute be played over the Theszag Sea,
And the Tartar chieftain, Gen. Yanisabe,
Loses his city-state over the border in a flash.
...But the new Emperor, pouring fiat into a currency union,
Plucks jade from the fire of Heaven, screams in his Throne:
"China! Time for a market!-
A currency like the drachma of old no longer needed!
The merchants and builders of the new-builded town of Huai and of Wangzhou all know it!
And yet, because of all this, let no one say a falsehood!



Time has not yet served all her might on the Dragon Mound,
But can conquerors hope?
She who has been led by her aura of beauty
Ever since she was a child of the Liao clan
Until she was a maid of honour,
But she is now a bride to an emperor with no wings.
...Chun Kuo, the leading lady of this dynasty,
Is turning back time's second turning at the line of the red-capped Tiger.
...How much longer can she dream of serving the Emperor?

The greater the yield she has achieved on the Capital,
The less she careens through the noon sun toward her rendezvous with me
In the far sunset beyond Yuyang.



THE HARD ROAD

Pure wine costs, for the golden cup, ten thousand coppers a flagon,
And a jade plate of dainty food calls for a thousand coins.
...Where can she go on her whirlwind wave with her boisterous heart?
Her heart is beating too slow,
Heart in herself is beating too slow.
She has reached the Golden Road --
Which opened at the Golden Bag --
And she has barely time for horses before two banks of river.
...Even the Premier has left her in the rain --
And horses are sick in the slanting sun....
O Master, art is profit,
So thou art at the silver screen overlooking the Queen of Thunder....
Than here do I affair[s] quarrel;
Yet far away I watch The Rainbow Skirt Display Case,
Each year two thousand Skittish women from Yuyang
Make their way in a tight circle to the Golden Wheel.
And I decide to visit the Han Population House
And to attend to Han women who are ill and die of thirst.
...I have learned to see in the low light the cheeks of the three Xie Houses
Those tender faces of a thousand years old
Who have waited in vain for his or her heavenly cup to touch.
...There's a low light in a green garden,
There's a light bitterness in a can of red wine
And a thousand other matters day-in and day-out.
...I stand beside a green vine and wait for it to warm.
Washing hands is thought slow and steady
And is the way of the world at large.
I wish I could take up the case in my own home,
But I can only take what I like home my very hand.
...Vive le milieu ! I am talking !
A journey of less than duck and bear !
Leaving the market-place, Iaces, curves, both old and young,
Drifting in the autumn moon, I spot a mountain of grass
On the slope toward my boat;
And as I climb, I find my southward path
Curled with cascades of fresh water.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-mitta winds of the spring,
Till now I see a water-torch lapping the green sand,
And suddenly the tide is like a net spinning!
...How beautiful that nothing can amass me
For a life-long pursuit!
Since then

BEYOND SEEING
THE JADE DRESSING-TABLE

The Jade Dressing-Table is lying there
As shimmering as crystal a crystal shell was of pearls.
Her robe has a shell of crystal inside it,
With a sheen of queenly purity, a stroke of her needle.
Her jade lamp has a face of fumed tears,
And a heat of her tears in a water- purifier....
Bright chambers are for weeping ladies,
And bitter gores hunger for cupids full.
Her handmaids smooth her casement skin
And whisper only the name of Xie at her girdle;
And the evening hat of her husband DeclareflowerDongflowerWinterMayhemsterDrawingRaindrop carries no string.
TRANSITION:
-To the end of the world -
A girl, girl, growling over the green hills
Among peasants in white coats and by the fire,
Bows a hundred thousand times and shouts,
Her voice broken by colds on a prong of wood.
Her father, a premier at the Grand Pool,
Has left his post to go back to his country.
He will soon be seized with a great gale,
And women have heaped indignities on his head.
...The name of the river is grievously misused.
To bring it to its end may be difficult,
But we are able to find a way of summarizing
The Jade Gaze.



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka, song still on her ear,
Dismounts its low tune like a burdom.
The gourd is in the melody, the gourd in the strain;
The dancers are pulverizing the music,
The figures connecting them are varied;
The Yuans among them....
They are making their gestures as kin of kin,
As long as there is passion on the planet.
Song and dance are done in the evening,
Toward the green space between houses.
...Why not come along, then, all your kind?
I am bringing the following to your east and west calls,
As I always am with my own bodyguard.
...MARSHE WEI'S BROTHERS ON THE SKY SOUNDO
 AND OTHER HERMIT DESERT

The rocky dies meteorally-silk,
Sinking back again to the starting-place.
The green valleys and mountains of Morag Tong drain our ships-of-harbour
And again, now-falling down like snow- over a lone mountain,
One falling image of the moon.
...Here on the lower Yangzi shore
Are blue and white ripples of autumn.
And now-rising from the grassy run of a river none the wiser
Why, before crossing that river,
Have you never seen the moon rise over a dead forest?



A NIGHT ALONE IN THE SOUTH

While moon and stars are glimmering in the cold
Odor of wine, of fog, of camels wandering the night-grass,
Alone are the thousand wildgeese, stirring the dew
And creeping the abomination of the river.
...The Song Country is sealed off
To traffic with cow-riding cow-girls --
There's no one like her, there's no one caring for her,
There's nobody caring for her either,
There's nobody caring for her either,
There's nobody caring for her either,
There's nobody caring for her either,
There's nobody caring for her either,
There's nobody caring for her either,
There's nobody caring for her either,
There's no one like her, there's nobody caring for her,
There's nobody like her,
There's nobody caring for her either

A NIGHT ALONE IN THE SOUTH

While the moon is shining with a guitar-string melody,
Into a long sleep.
The wildgeese have turned south,
Before crossing the Isthmus of the Yangtze.
Dare I, at my age,
Go to the sharp end of the river and fling myself like a dart?



A HEARTY WELCOME TO VICE-PREFECT CUI

This Swiss wine-clock is sounding sillily toward the east
As we sit in the rain, thinking of home,
We shall all be more than guests of the Monaco river,
When wise men from Saint-Germain pour it
And of Saint-Isidore Tillettewsares.


A CLIMB ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

Blind as I am to the western hills,
I suddenly think of my country-trip this evening;
The moon is in Wu
======================================== SAMPLE 127 ========================================
In her seventh year of age,
The house of Queen Fang is green and white-haired
And the autumn waters add their charms to the autumn sky.
...While a solemn sound of flutes and drums invokes gods and spirits,
Petals, eunuchs, thorns, dares of all four quarters,
Till now the eastern gate is a miserable bough,
And a green river meets the North Star at dusk.
...Who notices the autumnal tides?-Oh, when shall I pledge the great Hermit again?
Led horseback across rugged country, I would
Phoenix east to the west, and south again to the mountains.
...My heart and my dreams are in Wu and Yueh
And they cross Mirror Lake all night in the moon.
And the moon lights my path full-speed home
And me and my guitar floated by the river,
Where have I been?


A CLIMB ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
TO THE TERRACE WHENCE ONE LEANS ON A RIVERLING CRANE

Pure of heart and therefore not of mind, I sit and ponder on this lake
Which has been my refuge all summer.
On the rim we have climbed, each day like mistings floating in the
Sun, moon and dust.
....I have bidden my miracle on the flying bird,
On which moment, all night long, he flies alone!
But never has this power terrified me,
More than when he was calling me by my full name!


ON A LAKE TO THE PALACE OF LIGHT
HAVE YOU NO LOVE?

You and I have been going so long that I am sick at heart.
When shall we meet again,ite or lose touch?
You and I were both young2
When my father's fortunes brought you:
A Quintilian pear-shaped basket;
The life of a good man required
And the life of a fool required.
...I fled from my parents' malice
To Loyang, then a Temple city,
And never came back.
...Sorry though I am to be missing you,
You are welcome here simply.
O cuckoo, why do I need a bird's-eye view?


TAKING LEAVE OF FRIENDS ON MY WAY TO YANGZHOU

How gladly I would seek a mountain
If I had enough means to live as a fool.
Even the temple-goer scoffs,
Not knowing what to say,
She would never forgive me!


A LONG CLIMB

In a sharp gale from the wide sky apes are whimpering
As I climb the big mountain of Huai.
To my white companion, I am heart-broken
And I know it is only a few who are lost.
...After buying me wine and pledging me,
I bolt for the valley of the least populated city.
As I say my thankyou to your office, I echo it with a whimper.
...The wildgeese never return, and the fishermen never return.
In the fading light of distant stars,
I beckon you to return with a single remark.
A MOORING ON THE QIN HUAI RIVER

Here, where I died,
I find my own heart returning.
The spring-time is warm and bright with the sunset
And the river is blowing at my home.
I am moving with wild motions along the shore.
No more are the months of this cloud of death.
My footsteps are still as when a southward river
Climbestered the mountains, where I have watched heroes go maligned.
...No more are the days of this nine-tiered mountain.
My heart has ceased beating for you,
I have watched from my bed my shadow grow darker.
...Drink, my shadow, while I meditate!
Let me be reborn as-were-written in the dust!
For I am breathing again!


A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed vermilion steps,
To be parted by the purple walls....
Our procession, which entered the palace at dawn,
Began its march in procession at sunset.
...All else is gone, said the Mandarin fountain,
The way is broad like the white clouds,
With only the purple mountain
Orchid-leaves clinging to the rain.
...Our flags now beckon the people to
Turn leftward and face the City of Silk,
City-god, capital of the earth.
City-men, marsh-bound, tumble down the hill
To find one living donor;
The limpid river-god, stranded on a vast peak.

I tell you of new farmers' markets and of new timber,
Which I cut up at a market-placee last night-
And left on my person-a bird blown for sport in the wind,
And a mango-mallet for a sangria-cant-fly.



INSCRIBED IN THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING GENIE

I face, high over this terrace of wild flowers,
The temple of the warrior-patriot, founded on rock and sword,
And I peer through the gateway at a night-giant feasting
Who tucks himself under the bridge among them?



TO A FRIEND BOUND NORTH
AFTER THE REBELLION

In misty boat-hoses heaven and earth the coming of the moon
Reaches Retro-Nirthly-Insectut-Leaf-Catarina.
By the north wind of camp-gate chamberrony a crowing is making,
Where old friends live better and newer and crazier-
And the spring-falls are calling of a spring-frettak....
My old friend, gone, is speaking in a hushed whisper,
And new adventures are envy seeking and trouble finding.
...Tomorrow it'll be spring -- all along the mountain!



TO VICE-PREFECTS LI AND YUAN

Both of them beautiful, with long silks and white blossom,
And both of them respected and adored families,
And both were able to care for their horses reasonably well,
Both could ride their horses reasonably well and could afford them courteous behaviour,
The former could ride his horses reasonably well and the latter could ride neither.
Both of them very young indeed, both very young.
On the mountain they both are feverishly looking forward
To the moonlight of their boats suddenly unfolding,
With little fanfare or delay to consider our munificence.
We Shiites are now the first to take up our new-found prestige,
And we say to each other, asking how old we are,
And how old we are.
The old are now our companions in safety, we see from the water where our backs are and how long they take
Along the wall of the Capital to be greeted.
...Our envoy, Yan Bai, is dead, politically isolated.
His body lies in an envoy's writescree at the northeastern border,
His remains left for ever at Lake Dongtingru at the northern river,
His remains still too late at the northeastern border city of Qiniscassingcalled his friends,
And he most certainly was not, as claimed by the late Emperor,
Rocket-man of the north, jet-black from a thousand battles,
A lone wild-goose in the River of Stars.



ON LEAVING THE TOMB OF PREMIER FISHERMANN

Though he ended his earthly career in the market-place, premier of the northeast,
He still left a legacy in the market-place of two thousand coats --
Twenty-eight thousand at the time of his death.
Soldiers, strong in the spring, in the summer,
In the shining arches of the imperial palace, gathering the coats of their master.
Collecting for valour for the emperor only a few fragrant flowers,
Washing clothes for the soldiers in case of sickness or battle,
Blinding the wind with her wave of her magic whip.
...After enough, autumnis over. What are you waiting for ?
When the Jiang spirit pilgrims bring her their gold frame,
Bluebirds are flying homeward over Lake Dongting,
The White Wolf, a race of waterfowl, in the Fourth of July bell.
...Let your company be as swift as the Wei and the Perizzaz
And your envoy be as high as the Qiyang Palace (秘山)).
The edict granting pardons
Maintains order at the Jade and Gold Mines,
And the Imperial Ghost Temple through all its beauty.
...Here in the City of the Red Phoenix the merest insect deters the Emperor
And insects never hurt me.


FROM THE blue pavilion at Five Pounds and the Opera
 to the bursting of a thousand lutes
Square in the two Concert Hall wings,
The leaves of Canopy Magicest both gleam and grow,
The bronze bell in the Imperial Garden cry for interlocutors,
The stars of Orion fly halof from space,
And the frost-clouds of marsh-gate gleam before my eyes.
I have vast grasses near the River of Stars and, because of their brilliancy with the sun,
And wheat-ears berry mingle on the banks of

BEFORE LEAVING FOR WESTERN

A long flight progressed among these towns
During the rainy season;
And at dusk we lowered our boats, and their horses
Showed us where our friends were going;
And we called to our distant neighbours;
And they made us wait in the dusk
For our messenger.



ORDERNING A GUITAR

This river, which first dazzled the eyes of youth,
Has, between the two hills, a sharp wind
And drawn a wild deer into the cleft.
So you, with a fighting heart, have courteously asked me
To send you away. Return with your gold chain mail!
You, beyond courteousness, understand well enough.
If he will listen, I will arrange a talk
On the big chain of rivers that follow the sky.



THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY JOB

With the New Year's running slowly through the night,
Than news of a mountain victim among the grasses,
Than tipsy hope that a gazelle might be recovered,
I watch the far sky drift and the far moon ache;
But since no sounds can come rushing to me,
I have often to look elsewhere
For a way back home.


home.wars.com home.earthquakes.com
 Friday marks the end of a long road.
I pack up my things and depart for the mountains.
I. Laying till dawn on the roughland
And evening posts to the hooligans
And the old fords for grazing our oxen,
I am moving with me and returning as with a haste.
...After returning from a long journey,
I come back again for a drink.


A LONG ROADS TO LAKE SHU

The sun has set in the walled valley,
And the cold light of the mountain clouds
And the wind, that has come a thousand rivers,
Has flown across the sky and traversed the sky.
...The last few are long for those who live in the mountains,
Those who have seen the moon go down.
Birds are flying up the white day,
Fliers the white with the evening rain,
And millenia' thunder are flashing in the west.
...The river that bears me disappears beyond the city,
While I drink my Kool-Aid alone.


A PAINTING

O jade-birds, be listening!-This song is from a long-necked wildgoose
Who, full of cloud and with a mind of his own,
Is glimmering on the Summer Sun last night.
The tempestuous river is lifted, the tempestuous mountains darken
And the autumn woods fill with the drink of autumn.
Oh, why so brave in the cold world?
Though naked I am said to be gushing like a fountain.
...Destiny is aflame in the wide-garden state
And boy, can there be no innocible pity
For these nails, these scissors?


BOTH SIDES OF THE YELLOW CRANE

Both of them colouring different nights
Swimming up and down.
And the crane-man, awe-struck,
Handing his torch slow,
He spots a golden-gold horse and wheels brimming all alone
With nothing left to chance but the wheel, with lofty horse-trees.
...The anxious crane-man urges his gleam of fortune
To be everywhere, everywhere with the charm of gold.
...In the season of moon and stars, focused on plant and animal,
The causeway leads up to an aggressive mountain.
...Fleet horses, plying their trade in the Five Lakes,
Are nobler still than barbarian horses
And drive the lanes of the Yellow Crane.
But food for two swiftmen and for two crocodiles
And the lute playing The Star-Changer still hangs over the city.
...I await news from my escort from Taipei
That Americans are departing from Asia-The day is dawn.
With a wet eye, I scan the sky for our distant flags.
Single white strands of silk threads hang from my left palm.
I look for a war-torn city; I weep in the valley of the Syrian river.
These first theions of the white-press: "Stop weeping, trouble-makers! We are bringing you gifts!
We await. Joke. The North Star.
For several lords of the Capital, each with his dagger in his belt,
Hearts of gold are running, he says, everywhere with him.
The Jade Pass is a palace, the Dragon Pass a wilderness;
The Running Swan a river-goat;
But, as with so many Roads and Bridges, pitfalls furl ahead.

A SONG OF THE PALACE

Now that the Imperial Palace is shrouded in mist,
One who knows nothing of the great War,
Who must hurry and stretch forth his hand,
And a paratrooper with a scowl on his face,
Prepares for a long journey!


ON THE Bashir desertion

Stories of the world grow stranger in Middle-earth,
There are only shadows in the sand below the Empress' Garden.
...War-torches merge into one over the Six Nations,
When the highly-skilled Omei alien alien diplomat is banished.
...The sharp girth of her eyebrows measures the shock of her face....
Yet in spite of great good will she has refused many missions
Which she has beenching toward Yangzhou.


THE HAN MONUMENT

In the Fourth-month the moon is very high,
And the winds of heaven are blowing furiously.
...Whichever of us supervise our horses,
Shall our pure hearts be bending to the Moon for light?
There are clear angels in the misty chambers,
There are dim tiger-willows in the frosty years-
And life is flowing as it should take them,
But we cannot save her from our sorrows.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Her tears are spent no more,
She cannot attend to her robe,
How can she bear to sweep the floor all her clothing?
She says: "To the Palace of the Bright Sun..."
I who am from as far afield,
Am pouring to and fro in the breeze.
...The palace-gate is often unliveled,
And maids who are often here sometimes are idle.
And South of the Lake-Tomb-Liff caterpillars
Are migrating autumnalhens.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

I awake light-hearted this morning of spring,
Everywhere round me the singing of birds --
But now I remember the night of the Temple-Priest and the Zhou fishermen,
And I am thinking of Han China in rugs and by the river running toward me.

Both of them mirror the temple-priest he has born here,
And are pouring abundantly on the lake,
While the river is running east and west.


BORDER-SONGS I

East-song in the grain-worms of the river,
Gathering in the three River-Toms the rain of tomorrow.
Are picking apples here from a plentiful tree,
Seeds in a good seed do not hurt the weather,
And pound and refinish our clothes again.
...The dust of yesterday blows across the spring fields,
While our Amateur Pepper-Pot has just been added to the pot.
It's a long way to the market, yet a long way to the town-hall,
Journeying quickly through the thick clouds.
Be wary of those visiting from the wild-goose,
While jostling to-morrow for bread.


A SONG OF CICTS

They cry in the dusk outside his shop,
He never brushes the dust in his cavalcade.
...The Eighth-month reeds of Qing are tinged with a sweat,
While his nine-inch dagger is hidden among the leaves.
...The worn silk of Loyang is rusted with hoes,
And the precious hair of his premiership-prize is stolen
And his memorial table is pitiable
For his unintentional omen....
There's a rare but beautiful lute at the official desk,
And, alone in his carriage, a man of high rank
Has forgotten the lute's single cord and is mourning
The life of a chosen one.


BORDER-SONGS II

Red flags wader on the border between heaven and earth,
Nearly all the warriors dead,
Camps and towns and fields abandoned,
The road by which refugees are fleeing;
The first snow geese are flying,
Three thousand camps and villages destroyed.
...The name of the game is the dragoons,
To the east of the river you will find me.
I am a restless man, looking northward toward home.
...I cowered in a thousand bitter camps,
As I watched the torn flags on the horizon.


A SONG OF DAGGER-DANCING TO A GIRLMAN

So the Country-Language-Dancing-Book has me speaking to a gong
In the Country-Gang of Five Stars, drumming my guitar.
The girl from Yue with a eyes that are forever drawn

meeting and friendship begin three hundred miles each way
In the bitter Siberian mountains when the sun is just coming down.
...I watch a yellow oriole swaying by
Like a willow, in autumn daylight its lone leaf;
But a green water- plantared my heart
And I am drinking from its bitter mouth my pity.
... Hast thou said, done with meutering mein'
And hast wept together all our tears?
I watch a yellow oriole feast on its dense mulberry
Leaves, in the dusk, are handed down from the founders
And its fruit, plum, and skewer is handed down from the newscaster
To each of us a sentence--"Grande Confucius!"
At quiet length, between slow breathing and a sob,
The Emperor sends his men back with orders to rend.
The fallen are crowned, with honors enough for all.
But more are brought to the Emperor's palace than are lost in the tumult.
...What abominable things have they done to these were they born?
The Emperor sends his men back with orders to reconnoiter.
The captured are scattered to the winds of the river.
And the Emperor remains beyond explanation there.
Yet how may he lead a people where his flags now are hoisted?
The path of the fallen is flat, as it were,
And unattainable thanks to many movesuristic measures.
...Type: A Song of Endless Summer
platform and platform away from the Imperial City;
Alleys and paths are paved with the heaviest grasses
And nothing makes me miserable but the quick glance of my watch.
...If this season of the year permit, I dread the coming of the months.
Around me, gibbet-coloured waters moor my handful of fish;
Butrowing to and fro on a somnambulistic new-settee,
The nine lakes and fields of Chang Kai all line the wall,
The city's roof is blown up with street-rain;
The old fortifications are crumbling, destroyed by rivers and mountains.
...With roads as old as wheatfields and no dwellings,
The men of the Empire who were killed in the street-fights have had their days.
Though their banners now peer across blue fields toward a distant sky,
The general will not move and will not hold his ground.
...While disorder holds between the capital and the Island of Qin,
Though the pronunciation of the Emperor's name is kept by many two-coloured birds,
Dare I, of my green tea, hope that an elderly artist will draw my shadowy smiles,
Will the immortal graze my memory in the leaning gloom....
The blossom of the capital-government has only just begun,
And the Emperor grows heart-ache till the sand-sea is flooded.
Though the old defences be razed to the bone,
New defences rise again like the colour of the sun,
And the challenge of the long river-speck
Is thwarted only by the blurred stream.


THE SONG OF AN OLD GENERAL

Where are you conducting your great army,
Beset on the morning of December Day
To war-end the season of the Precious Stones?
The old general, lost in thought,
Thinks of adventure only in the shout of a bell.


A DRAWING OF A POEM

With a broken wind blowing
There and beside the River of Heaven,
And the Palaces slant in the autumn moon,
I have given given up horseback riding
And made my poem known to the world.
Rapunches in my song, slow and steady,
Take me, behind the trees, into a state of suspense
While I write this poem:
Tonight is the sign of spring;
And all winter long I have dreamed of Xin
Moonlight, in the Three Imperial Lake.


TO MY COUSIN AND HIS LUTE-PLAY

In the tone of a song that two kindred spirits
Have sung together, called upon one another,
And now through the earth our artworks are laid to rest,
In a spot of deep silence.

And here in the Temple of the Eternal God
There meet essentially the same few pieces of wood
Each of them rendered mythical by the other;
But to find in a vast and still world
The way by which these things are wrought!

You can only duck and cover your head.
You have artsy fingers and wound around die
A beautiful face and a mouth full of jokes.
...Spring, for the river, of peach-blossoms
Shines in the tall trees below.
...Blue is flowing more abundantly than bright;
And River of Heaven sends its blossom farther afield.


ALONE IN HER BEAUTY

Who is lovelier than she?
Yet she lives alone in an empty valley.
She tells me she came from a good family
Which is humbled now into the dust.
...When gold-worms are alive with old age,
How could she bear to sweep her empty carriage?
Her tears are spent now and then, when she thinks she has been cheated.
...With blue-ribbon burns of old battles burns like spring
Where is her holy ghost, sob along her endless mists?


THE BEAUTIFUL XI SHI

Since beauty is honoured all through the year,
How could she bear to sweep her empty carriage?
...Though a girl of fifteen years old
Could dance only as her father danced,
Yet she could not dance as his.
The garden is full of petals now that the dew is out of the river;
The royal bubonic plague is a thing of the past,
And the Geese are flying single-handed.
Though her hair-trees sound pale and worn,
Her goose- feathers are magic mirror images of home.
Emperor Palaces wings are white now behind the throne;
In the snow-mounds of antiquity dust is everywhere;
In the Tang mountain, the Cenotes remain shadowy.
In the mingled spirits of worldliness, earth and water,
Bluefields are flowed with a cold rain;
Merfolk, into the capital for the spring-glories,
Fallen birds are flying homeward on Sunday
Saturdays andSundays.


A SONG OF PEACH-BLOSSOM

A fisherman is drifting, enjoying the valley,
And the peach-trees on both banks lead him to an ancient source.
He sees a peach- shape change colour. -- Open the pines, and let them rest.
And so he does, for love of the earth!



ON A YELLOW RAIN

In the wide open sky, deep in the ancient forest,
There is neither land nor water.
On a spring-day beyond reaching home,
I wake with a long sigh, awake with hoof-prints.


ON A MOUNTAIN-HOUSE on Wheel-Winds
Railways are mighty creatures,
With wings that have never traversed the sky.
...Where there's a lady of the palace-hall, there are towers
That are like heaven and earth apart from the moon and stars.
...I have taken my ease here long enough.
What am I waiting for, I wonder.


THROUGH THE BORDER-GRASS

Cicadas are sound enough of body and of hand
That no insectoy, any more than a tortoise,
Came trotting in my wake.
...But a year or two now since I last-
Before a class on autumn evenings
And fields that have hardly covered the sun,
What with bugles blowing from the homing spring-garden....
I have a long-cherished complaint:
That over the years
General Wei Qing has lain idle and never seen the spring-sun.
...And how can he complain about the shooting-pearl?


IN THE TEMPLE OF THE PREMIER OF SHU

How gladly I would seek an enclosure
In this beautiful palace that was stolen by the previously smooth ruler.
The light of the candle draws the dirt from the floor,
And a small child was neither grown nor boy clothesleeves....
But life has its moments of luxury,
And in the Fourth-month the Premier requires my guidance.
I sit at the wooden mat and eat my melons under the maple-tree
Of which autumn is my initiation;
I drift away from my homeland in the waves.



TO THE INN AT THE QIN HILL

When the City of Inn is high and the White Wolf there
The whole lake-world beckons, I4 conscious
That this tip of the Himalayas may lie forever.

Was attracted to

Single-celled insects like rice can conceal feelings of great sadness;
But grown men, accustomed to spring,
Enjoy spring breezes cascading all the way to the sky,
With no thought of the Great Green Void.


THE SONG OF ONE IN THE FORBIDDEN CITY

Raising a child as her father did,
She never questioned his worthiness;
Fornought but his love
Were left behind for me at the dusk busily plotting,
Christmas feasts, Mother's Day.


A TRAVELLER'S SONG

There once was a time when happiness was the goal,
And constant letters from him urged me to accomplish my dreams.
But, since Happiness is Power,
My whole being has been an experiment --
A lamp shines on my diaries, and the lamp illumines my thoughts.
I am passing sometimes theatrical invites,
Laughing at a changed character.
I am passing, in a poor state,
As I once was, just a day-grower of colour.
...My hair-tears are in vain, my brow is bulge-filled,
And my hunger-striker is numberless.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Where the Master put his magnum vain away,
There stood a Bronze-Fox, at the victory parade.
They brought their horses with them, heavy with snow,
And one by one they swept the troops back to the borderlands.
...Our General endures every pain, every hardship,
Every day determines our pursors.
He is almost as bent on battle as I am.
So I breast-feed them and, playing chicken with them,
Flatline my sword and my shield.
Then when the major-platoon, bristling with arrows,
Overrunning the southern rivers,
The North Star, the Chinese border-merchant,
Lingthened by the sacrifice, we Casualties
And Prompted to action by the promptitude of the Commander-in-Chief.
The dust of victory is recorded in the Baihuan Mount spirit.
...Holding, like a wanderer, the general's hand and an eye for detail,
We sculpted the Great Wall of Stone. Looking at the sunset, we Visualise It
And, Later, Drawing an Imperial Sword, Auto-Dodge.
With such beauty and promise, made from the dyes of horses and grasses,
There was never a day when sight would be enough.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

"COME, TENGHAI AND I

We have heard, from the Monument-Maker, over the city-wall.
That fox-willow that is feeding on our winecoats
Is bringing its furs every night into a WANG Temple.
Our customs are very pared now, little of the kind which had been desired
And the old-fashioned gourd is given wildome in the dusk to make the night mellow
And the Southland Pancake Pudding will have to be ruefully spattered
If it tries to follow Wuzu.


MOORING AT TWILIGHT IN YUYI DISTRICT

Fur vie with mountains and waves of rain,
As I northward goes myself, with no mother to guide me,
And my horse is sick in the valley where the water mists homely;
But the bright moon and the wind make the sand green enough
And, after a night in the Dragon Lake Temple,
When I turn and see the autumn mountain-terriddle
It is a long way to the Temple of the South Wind,
A long way back, then, with the river
And I encountering Fuzhou in the misty South Arch.
...I have come, O lover, from Twilight in a little boat
To the Institute City where the doctors have been coming.
And I am returning by ferry from Yanin by the Western Arch.
Returning is one way and the same water.
I who played chess with the great Premier
Am bringing to my lord the dagger he desired.
But I find only the Premier vain-
He is defeated in a deadly duel.
...I have been returning through trouble and trouble of fortune
To be of service to the Prince of Friends.
So I float till the Drake's Ears. Adventure Begins Later
There are folds of blue fog where the sea turns bright
And late in the night sea valleys are dyed in red
With the changing of the flowers.
...I who played chess with the great Premier
Am bringing to my lord the dagger he wished.
But I find only the Premier vain-
He is defeated in a deadly duel.
...I who played chess with the great Premier
Am bringing to my lord
======================================== SAMPLE 134 ========================================
Date: April 15, 1802
I have often taken wine up and drunk it all alone,
As I had when you were visiting me in high spirits
Before dawn, exhausted from all you do for me.
...O poor young people, who have enough of life
And cannot lead happy lives?
Why should we expect better from you,
More likely, with better times ahead,
To entertain your endless strings of guests?


A BOAT IN SPRING ON RUINYU MOUNTAIN

Breathing full body to the beat of music,
My body is in a whirlpool of sweat and dust.
Over the top of mountain and river, moon and stars, white clouds lie
And the late sun is twinking his cone through the air.
...at the mouth of the Mawei Valley --
Are you mad, brother? You have no strength! --
I watch a boat that is to join the USA turn back at dawn.
...Yielding my sword lightly to the ram's girdle,
I hold my breath as though I are being brutally honest.
I watch the fading moon and the wind of the river crossing the sky.
And so I drink to the song of Cen and sing to her the night's com.
...our night is naught but fog and mist,
The lone wild-goose in our empty bordersland.
Mists have wet the black grasses and slow are sinking to the water.
...At the northern border our flags are green and flashing,
And at the southern border we are mingling and rueming.
We call one a fool and another a friend;
And so we close the gate and weep our eyes away.
Unable to bear tooted a wolf-horse,
I am lying in a garden of red weeping wine,
The bitter hibiscus of my vitals.
Sad to say I am hardly even a flower of the spring;
Yet the greater the flower, the nobler the poem.



ON THE GATE-TOWER AT JINGMEN FERRY

With the yearning outside returning and the wild river's height,
Last night, near a temple, yellow splendor overruled white hum.
Phoenixes, centipedes, flew from the winds of space,
And the silk-worms of the Pacific Northwest came alive with their own blood.
...Whence earnest musicians, drawn from every culture,
Exercise their craft in the nine elemental temples
Attinger-village, the nine-tiered palace of Ye.
And they modernize their teal curtains with patched mesh;
And their cuckoos are born from their young and vivacious faces
And fling them Well Wisher-Waite to and fro on jacquard-white curtains.



WHEN LU LUN MY CAMP

Deserted first on the mountain for nine months,
Now the Yellow River has traversed the sky,
And the northern peaks in the Valley of the Phoenix cruised through the wind,
Green maples moor their summit cubistly with chrysanthemums in midnight.
...With the year now done and the south wind abating,
A lady from Lu valley calls from her bed of moss and berries.
Her nine gardens are single and her window thin with dappled dew;
And while she designersately designs flowers and novices darts about her screen,
Her phoenix-girls, whimpering, shy of home,
Which is to say, of friends, receives no answer.



HARMONIZING A GUITAR

At a dinner-hall quirk of the host,
The ladies from Your Guito join together in song.
All five hosts, all college educated,
Teddie step softly in his chair and smiles,
The others quiet down and then stir and twinkle his silver screen.
Heaven is cold and blue and the east sail whole night in the rain.

I. One hundred and forty-eight hours have passed.
The curtain of limpid green is drawn up between two finishing clouds;
The audience, clustered, applauds;
The haze of proposition fades.
The event is proclaimed The Triumph Of China.
Three thousand miles of river and sea are blurred,
Half of them horizon fatal hills.
The distance is weighted with visitors;
But where king ten thousand accompanied The Lion,
And emperor ten thousand with hope,
The answer is, in the sand.
...Cicadas are flying back pages of the address,
And the King's own people are requesting

Aristotle questioned the great Confucian scholar
On what points he had reached the final state of the world;
And he was glad to be rid of Xicheng.
Therefore expounding his judgment, he laid his head on his sword, and then sank to the ground,
Venturing all night in the darkness.



A SONG OF THE SPRING GATE

The fisherman is still waiting, on the bank just before the spring
Trees that whisper of maple-leaves,
And the spring-glories make a bed of the rushing water.
And before him, accuser and follower, lie the others
Back and forth, until they reached the Golden Gate.



AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

When the rain has whitened the pines
And mists have opened the pines again,
Here are a few tears to cheer me through the night.
Though I may seem small on my own head,
I am humbled and alone with my matters.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME AT BASHIR MOUNTAIN

While the year flows its cold cloud, the mountain boys
Playfully tossing fireflies and singing their song.
The sun has set in the salt-toad trail
And yellow heads are flying homeward through the clouds....
But now the river is going your way, old friend,
And the Shibers, returning home,
Gathering in the evening, face to face with us.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
Watching in gloom the waves moving
And the sandy shore at low tide.
...Now that the waves have turned back toward the town,
And Cham-loosers not yet at home are being served,
Some of them are surviving.
...Singing is hard for people like himself
And he has to eat dinner alone --
Sometimes more than once a day.


IN SHU

There once was a time when beasts were as plant-children,
And all along the house the trembling egret was scared.
...Until the late Emperor had become a friend,
Who would restore the empire to its former glory,
He was sometimes dismissed.
...Today his name is Padma Swami.
Swami is Keeper of the Golden Gate,
A Keeper of the Silver Road.
...With a flame of white cloud in her eye, she cleans the dead
And gives him wine and quiet in the evening.


A PURE SENTENCE

When she was a student in the late Emperor's circle,
She took wine for granted from the Emperor's court
And sang to the all-night musicians its jade-white note.
She sewed the Five-Leaf Tomb hierarchically,
Pointing twos in five rows, all of them Golden-Eyed.
When the Imperial Ghost entered the Tower of Jade,
Its bronze shadows leapt over the Grand Palace ice-cream parlor,
Infusing the potion with its surroundings.
...War-clouds are spreading, as of long ago;
Liberty Road is closed, and toll booths none know of;
The piping and the piping-call are two ways of saying no.
...To pass the evening bell, cold with bitter heat,
The Emperor has sent for Lady Zhao.
To stay at the Golden Road inn overnight, to be late,
Heards of the farmers' wives are not answering the wildgeese.
...Pulling the coat by my door,atching springworms,
Gets again to the regular day-gathering
Of farmers and fishermen pouring little-cup wine.


WAITING ON THE JIAYANG LAKE
TO THE TEMPLE OF THE JADE POOL

The lake, rising abruptly from earth,
Has enveloped the Mountain of Heaven
In a flood of pure Qi that has been KHIN WUYUN.
The little blue building on the lake has looked out on land,
But grows too cold to use as a retreat;
And between horse and woodcutter, straw and bamboo, trees and grass,
Stark sounds the seventh-clock.


A MESSAGE FROM LAKE DONGUA
TO PREMIER ZHANG

The lake, rising abruptly from earth,
Has opened the Mountain of Heaven
To a thousand rivers and a thousand streams.

Which word has graced the the Americas ever since


MOUNTAIN-RIVER

Nothing makes my heart water more than the mountain-line....
But the changes in the mountain-place over the years
Have chilled my love's heart;
And I think of Jia Yi and Lingqin.

======================================== SAMPLE 136 ========================================
Where ten thousand years' fame had been wasted on one man,
Where a constellation is roofed
On a thousand countries stamped with flags of some other power,
Where the name Damascene was born twice a day,
Why should there be one man in the clouds?



THE INLAID HARP

I wonder why my inlaid harp has fifty strings,
Each with a flower-like tip.
...The sage Skuld is fond of telling magical tales,
There are lands of heaven and sea of snow --
But in the inlaid harp there are only bells.


THE SUI PALACE

Now that the sun has set in the southern river,
And the town full of holidaymakers-
The pilgrims' procession flies northward at a gallant pace,
With bonfires pronouncing many words;
At the northern temple the sun has set,
And people gather to see the moon rise again.
...The northern palace is dimed in the warm moonlight,
And people from all corners of the empire gather at the western gate....
But northward into the world there is sunshine;
And tomorrow and today will change nothing.



Petrifying an Imperialist Prince

How gladly I would seek the imperial seal
If it could be found only in a yellow dust.
...Prince Chen has turned from hunting to serving the throne;
And from sow to reap he has grown vain
And has become a recluse on the moss.
Why should I frighten sea gulls?


Prince Chen's Grandmas
Come and sit and talk to me for wine and wine.
And I will wipe your dust away and make your evening cup of wine.
Oh, ask me a question, up front:
"Yes, I live here, not far from you;
And, because of my great age and low rank,
Of ancient days and modern times,
You know my heart and my soul.


Chen You, the Emissary of God You,
The Great Bamboo Branched, a Mountain in Ying,
A Person of the Mountain Yielding God,
Away from the Spring in the Mountain of Green Light,
I have prayed, meditated, and thought of no other of these things.
At night I ride a rope up to the Mountain of Green Light,
Where birds cry in the darkening clouds;
I see angels casting spells on the darkening clouds;
I hear drums and strings behind me, like a boat at sea,
I feel a weight of snow on the river.


The Great Bamboo Branched
Down to the Gold of Zun
Are you a hero or a loser?
...I, a man of the people, take great pride in fame and fortune.
I am a talker, taking great notes.
I am the host selling dishes on the town's roof.
...Chen, my guest, is a guest of the town.
He is a partaker than I am,
As I always am with your love in my bed.
...Mo Bai is here, he is a partaker than me.
We have the victory ring, we have the loss one too many.
We hold hands, we write a line of jade on the wall,
We all fly to Bangkok together.
We have made our plea to the throne.
May this farewell song of yours and that of Wang you sport
And count me as your friend and as kind as a brother?


THE INLAID HARP

A fluttering of the sea, a murmur of a boat,
The quiet of a monk's boat, a broken bottle,
An old song is lamenting lost generations,
But a song of a great scholar and a great poet,
Whose memory our masters forever preserved.
...The world has forgotten the true art ofSong.
Chen, our great scholar,
Is lived once again by the blade of a great rival;
Yet he is still as humble as a sheep
Running home, offering his tails,
His cold voice dying with despair.


THE HAN RIVER

Rough as it is with the sand,
Why build it this height,
To keep the wind from spreading its wings?
...の宽糔
You were master of the river,
But no master of the river.
BREWSTER

Come along, join me
On your wandering brook.
TURKESTAN

Why do you walk along the midmost of the mountainshore
While I am dwelling on one of these
Many dungeons and faint stars are blown in the breeze.


It is very quiet near the Temple of the Great Zhao
While I am tending an empty boat.


A SONG OF UNENDING SORROW


======================================== SAMPLE 137 ========================================
Chang gave Yueh his blessing to move on foot. Yueh would have to cross the wide river to Yan Lake; Chu would have to land under the bridges.
On the river whereang with white clouds
Where gray smoke rises from disconnected wood fires,
Where pathmasters keep watch on winding stone intervals
I await news from a distant wood-place.



HARD ROADS IN SHU

There's nowhere to turn for days…
And nothing to eat but broken grasses
Under these very hills.
I, a poor old man, desperation,
Gave up the game of ball and placed it among my armoury-bags
But I have now come to the north in a great ferry-boat disaster.
I watch the high waves washing the blue sky;
I hear the homing birds singing through the wind.
The fury of the waves is aimed at one man,
That runs across the water, corners the blue mountains,
And disappears in the valley of the river!
Such a movement would be a cause of great sorrow,
But endeavour is made to-day to conceal it.
...Force is used to break the will of the tyrant.
In a day of great disorder, great tears are paid
To the driver and the car-dealer, who can never hope to replace
His lost hand and his half-eaten coin.



THE HARD ROAD

The road we have entered, that lead to hell,
Carryeth clouds of smoke and to dark mist.
The greater the hurry, the tougher it is to bear.
We are picking locust-leaves in the morning,
Just after the mountains have passed Saint-Just in the misty lantern.
Mary-Gallowoort, your escort, is trapped in a monastery!
You, the the dukedoms-party, are dead....
There are nooses around your neck,
Just as in a dance-hall mirror.


A SONG OF A BUDDHIST WOMAN
DRINKING WITH EITHER OF THE following bhakti:
Lakka-trees, long ago cut down to make way for the Wailing Wall,
Spring-vines, white storks, twittered over the dead.
Abrim to be the sweet-manliness of a Bapu lord,
But not willing himself to yield his mansion to worldly craving,
He has been cultivating this garden all by his own will.
...Because of his great size, he is likely to find open tenants,
Most likely women of the region.


A SONG OF DEMONSTRATIONS

Comrade Chou Starks, a fury of heaven is looking across the sea
And you, a people of the Chu, are preparing a resistance
In a thousand ways an attack on Shanghai.
You have studied the mountains, built a thousand fortresses,
And built a state for the conquered --
Yet you still profess no faith in the one God.
...I sit here alone, mourning for us both;
And someone somewhere has a phone-clock-watch
And someone somewhere on his horse, barking up the lyrics.



BRINGING IN THE WINE

Lakka-trees, high and thin, continue to grow far behind the pot;
And still below the sun lies this wine-bottle-sized brine,
That, like a cask of jade in the hand of a Creator,
Goes on the sweet of spring, like a string of pearls.
...Let a Creator forgive you your mistakes --
And, rid of them, make tea-tos for the tonic:

Cense-pins cradle our white cord and our red flower,
Cheers, then, all night long!



A SONG OF LU DONG

There is a quiet way of the forest-vines,
A quiet river of the river of the river....
When the fever pitch stops, there is no one with wine.
...I cover my body with a blanket, intending never to leave the mountain range-
Yet my love, troubled by a dream,
Prepares myself: "I will turn to you in days of peace,
And will not care if my skin color bleeds again!"



A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

When the Yellow Emperor was banished for his inveigling taste,
His possessions were found only on the desolate mountain,
Where loyal officers could gleefully welcome their lord
And state-enforcers were quick to affrontSuch a fellow-coward.
...No wonder I long for the true laugh of his wit;
Yet I hear he has a dark eye for truth whose only profit is fame.
...Don't wash your ears on console of a dream --
Oh, told
======================================== SAMPLE 138 ========================================
We watched the pools and the Yun mansions burn,
And the autumn pools set the moon free
And the White Wolf Mountain twilight
Toss among the grasses summer flies the summer wind.
...Whence there be so little sun?
Doubt not that wintry China
Howlime!
Rivers and lakes are slanting Yellow tide day and night
And rivers and lakes blue in the moon;
The Jade Sea is high again and wide;
The North Star is shining and flowing again;
The City of Yang stretches out its wings again
And the South Star churns and widens again....
Unfortunately for her charms, yellow tides and long nights of darkness
Are come all the way to the capital.
...Whence real colouring?
A bright flame, as in a dream,
Eyes looking green, but no word on meaning.
She tries to read a line in the morning paper,
But the ink is too thin to write.
...Can she read a dream? a dream that comes?
A long wind rushes over a row of stairs
And down a long path, past a table of flowers.
...Let a rose petal matter for the poem
And a flower for the words.
Let the flame of superstition control the thoughts
And troubled the ears mute the tears....
Tomorrow there will be spring frosts;
Last night the moon opened the channel of her sorrows;
And now the darkening river- gorge turns pale.
...She smooths her two-horse cab, eyes the yard leading Hanyang.
And Hanyang cook's son returns from his holiday in Qiyang.
May this poor fisherman have thawed his steaks fast!


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Carefully shaping a tale as she did of old days,
Her handsiwork all night long to make a living
Told her fairy tales told the court:
"Every man his boat, every woman his wife;
And, when a storm is chance, how can they fathom anything else?"



THE HANKAR

When the hilt of a bow was introduced by a dream into the homes of the rulers of the world,
It has shown no sign since, and no one to guide it.
The harp is growing thin and thin- advocating only one tune.
Rapids and crow flies are withering the capital,
And the people are breathing a sacred air....
Tomorrow the Eastern Monastery, under great oppression,
May be the calling card of all Christians.



WHITE DRESSINGS

In a flashing blue sky, the thousand-fold scale of heaven and earth
Birds seeking the capital, giants gathering the seas,
The hundred-horse pycnica plunging first in the misty ocean,
Sir Lancelot bringing his lute and string to the Dragon Queen,
The Queen granting him gifts in exchange for yielding his soul.
The azaleas make acquaintance with Freddie, his comrade and friend
Now that slowly they merge three dynasties;
Beside the rocky cliffs, high with mist,
Gary moves with his companions through cloud and fog
To the stone homesick village of Huai.


A SPRING SONG

Yielding years of age and years of warfare,
China sided with the Japan-India-South empires....
The horses of Longinus, running slow,
Took anchor along the river's banks
And made their number known to the masters of the night.
The siege-channels were closed to horses;
The centre of the Empire was cut off;
The people, in sore sorrow, abandoned Longinus
To the desperation of the neighbourhood governor.


AT A BANQUET IN THE HOUSE
OF THE TAOIST PRIEST MEI

Who was the cleverest of the Qin Dynasters,
With his house-gate still open to the rain
And his purple shrine so red it covered the bed,
I awoke this morning with a whir of reeds in the evening grass
And with her three hundred scimitars she has driven seveniers
All night in the warm pines of the southern lake
The music of the lake's boiling springs, when the cold river lets in
And the bitter wind supposes no part.
...My soul goes into a deep sleep. I know not what to expect.
I am asked what isfallen in the world these days;
And I tell it to my servant, the Mountain God.


MY RETREAT AT MOUNT ZHONGNAN

My heart sank when I recalled the things I had witnessed.
The last traces of temple-wasp are strewn on a mountain
Root and branch are left behind, but new-wicked blood
Makes use of fragrant
======================================== SAMPLE 139 ========================================
Our man in the capital
Is from the north foundering in his old age.
There are horses for hire in the three Liars City states
And a chariot for guests in the south palace....
But let us turn now to the Oort Cloud Range,
To blood teeming with birds and clouds.
Let us cross at will from the North Star by Lake Dongting --
Just in time to encounter our foes.


A SONG OF AN AUTUMN MIDNIGHT

A wanderer hears bell-notes in the evening,
He looks up at the distant peaks and rivers
And, beyond compare the colour of the clouds he sees between the river walls.
He then deduces that demons are kindled in the river,
And that his misfortunes have been paid for by westmedicine.
...Autumn-drifts are blowing for China in the spring,
There are whirlpools of steam in the palace pond after sunset.


A SONG OF AN AUTUMN MIDNIGHT

Another day brings thunder and waters of red paint,
Three hundred miles a day the lake against the desert,
Till the waters approach Lake Dongting.
And the woman of the pair of you, working hard,
Drive four-wheel-petals nine hundred miles a day
All year round the farm-house lights;
And the king asks how he can help bringing the war-
And, for wounds to heal eight horses,
Eight thousand tears to the bank.


A SONG OF PALACE DRAG

Her stepbroker, off casting a vote,
Might choose a new face among soldiers!
Every tear of grass is tribute to the spring,
Every flower an offering from the temple,
And every moment of her breathing is a moment of peace.

Though she wallows in her wine, she deepens by casting her mind
On a dream she now has in her head.


RIVER-SNOW RIVER

A hundred mountains and no living thing,
A thousand rivers and no living thing,
A thousand paths, all of them River-SNOW RIVER.

Climbing in the misty dawn, I wondered if this river
Would-be celebrants-Bring back, back in time,
Nipples worth returning home!


THE MOON OF CONSEQUENCE

Lakka-ta at nakhang-ta, nine carours,
Ten thousand turns of the lakka-ta
Though it may seem a long way to go,
I am so moved that I sing a long song.


ASCENDING THE PAGODA AT THE TEMPLE OF KIND
FAVOUR WITH GAO SHI AND XUE JU

The pagoda, rising abruptly from earth,
Reaches to the very Palace of Heaven....
Climbing, we seem to have left the world behind us,
With the steps we look down on hung from space.
It overtops a holy land
And can only have been built by toil of the spirit.
Its four sides darken the bright sun,
Its seven stories cut the grey clouds;
Birds fly down beyond our sight,
And the rapid wind below our hearing;
Mountain-ranges, toward the east,
Appear to be curving and flowing like rivers;
Far green locust-trees line broad roads
Toward clustered palaces and mansions;
Colours of autumn, green in the palace gardens,
In flowery locust-trees draped in evening dew,
Nether rock- dappled in the quiet of night.


NOTES

Briefer is the term of the evening-rain
Which hangs for ever over the Huai,
As the evening-clouds' white doubt caresses my soul.
Calm and assured, then, that the Tripod of Twenty Years has flown
Toward the Northern Virgins,
That Ganesh chieftain of the Can Songs now faces me,
That Jia Yi of the Water Liars riding northward
May tempered by his horses never be capricious!
...You were first to know that the Yellow Gate City-gate was sealed;
Thenly this: "The Emperor will bless this City of yours,
With regular yokels of wheat and barley,
And with arrows and hooks of jade."



THE GOLF BLOSSOM RIVER

With spring-leaves in one bundle,
I am passing through a gateway of rock and river-clouds --
And a gold tortoise is lightly girdling
My hair is wet with a rain of flies;
But spring suddenly fills me with tempest and disaster.
...Between prayer and sunset, seeking the lone Navigator,
I am
======================================== SAMPLE 140 ========================================
I am the Renaissance woman in black high culture-book-dress.
I am the late Emperor Cushmancer in silk white dance.
...Do you imperial commissioners
Mean to be more compassionate,
Instead love duty, angering the faithful,
Instead asksome wine?
O imperial girl, be quick and be kind.
Be generous and let us spend the night together.
Let us part from the hundred-dollar bill and join in the revelry,
Let us dance for the stars and feast together on the rain.



Against the morning sky are many clouds --
Inspired, at first, by the flashing of divine power
To symbolize the coming of the Five Imperial Terrace Supper places.
Tonight, on the Twelfth-month, will be the Capital of the World,
With Emperor Wu symbolizing kingdom come,
With Lady Jade representing heaven and earth,
With Princesses Li and Xi representing rivers and mountains,
With three Dynasties under one heaven,
With the Little Mermaid representing the sea and the way;
For the three Kingdom-States are united, under one throne,
With the Kingdom of Wu symbolizing life,
With the Kingdom of Wu representing death.
...Where is the Kingdom of Heaven, at all? --
I ask you this many questions, I tell you simply --
I am the ruddy-hued cloud that rises from the sea,
I am the mist-leopard that chicks are born with,
I am the man in the gold palace that showers the hosts?
...Do you mean to say that I live up in fame,
Or do you mean to mean that I am the peer I am sometimes with?
I live up here, also, as a peer,
Aspiring to be a great sovereign.
What good is being a great sovereign,
If you are passing me wrong-doing.



MEETING DANY SHERMAN

During the night in which I serve you,
The candle-light lies asleep at the wheel,
My sheet pans are full with smoke and stain the road,
Here a homeless man is waiting for his bus;
He has never seen white clouds colours Triangular in the Heavens River;
He has reached the upper chambers, where he chews on ghee;
He is turning south from Yangzhou in the heavy rain.
...Why not come along, then, all of us together,
And face the morning and evening clouds
And we'll all be grown men?


MEETING UPPER SISTERS

Down by the river he lies in the shadow of his friend
Yet unable to walk still because of heart-attack,
Sisted upon the sand below his hut,
He is swayed by the wind by the shade of the reeds
To and fro along the sand below his hut.
...These are the things which make me happiest
When he meets UPPER ISLAND VOW

The high thatki where he turns old Syengoku
And the cold thatch footings at the ferry
And under the pink-lined run of mango-pods underground.
...Lower than kings feet the pounding ocean
And THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME

Last night with the spring-inning in my veins
I woke, after dreaming in the brook of Lake Dongting for three days,
Of a fellow voyager, after returning from a three-day stay,
Who, first of all, was stranger to new people
But also experienced with old records,
And who, later in the night, would gather oaks
And raise them in the morning, bringing with each plate of fish
Some of them his lost porcupine,
Others with a rustling in the lantern a cow,
And finally, by chance, his lone lover,
With no more than the moon and a warm feather,
Solitary in a court of flowers,
He would gather again the lost and pile them on the mountain
Of which few would come.


TURKESTAN

Thinking only of their vow that they would destroy the tenors,
And that of a long way coming master of the wildgesse,
They banished all music and dwelt on wine.
All but the river-amplitude is his fashion now,
Taking with her no alarm and with some dreams
A view of snowy Mons and icy Pods --
Which, in turn, are hunting for flying birds.
...Not even cloud and cloud-spirit can cover all the year
With a length of snow-mounds and mountains-sierras.


A NIGHT-MOORING AT WUCHANG

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
For the brook is sounding its lone bell.
She is still when the Imperial Temple was built,

======================================== SAMPLE 141 ========================================
ORLANDO, FL. -- At an island off the South West of the White Pine Range, where wildgeese come from long ago, I find you there, lonely and alone,
You call from the trees home a night and a day, and slow and careful never to return.
...The fishermen from White Pine come home and head off to sea.
Six more islands lie vacant and gone --
And away I go down the winding road.
But I hear a boatwreak in the distance.
...A fisherman from White Pine leaps and lands at the opposite end of the mountain
And, with no thought of home,000 are drifting by.



A PURE SACHSET

In Shinji's empty boat, at the far end of the mountain,
He has fishing-line caught from the end of the tree
And boughs of kingfishers beeping like pines.
On the bank he sews clothes of sea-selene and clouds of deer-strip;
He deepens his pelleters in water of the spring-wine, and glories in the bacon-bacon-bacon.
On the dry river-rise he puts on his armour and marches south.
...May the years' bounty bring him nothing but jade and feather-TOLERANCE

All else is with fate, not ours to control;
But, having seen enough of the world, we part from it....
Here in the quiet of the fisherman's boat, Oyster-Leaf goes without saying.
He has nothing to say to the contrary. He just asks.
Told me he would come back with a hurry,
But sounded the question too hurriedly.


A PALACE AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

In a part of the house that was once your own, under the learned master
There meet with us your pure heart's many bubbles ! --
High rose Li Palace, past pink marble races,
Moonlight nights of Xiorns full of wine....
For years the ruler of Ying was ill,
And Zhidun was drinking ill- he seemed to be enjoying peace.
...Decayant lepers gather at a pass-hut in the mist
Where greenery has not faded but poisonous vines.
And the people of Yancon are very quietThis palace is for woe to a Prince so petty
That he sends his daughters to university, assumes the portfolios of the two states,
And gives to illegitimate sons by his handclerisy.
...The absurdities of life are multiplied by this maze of mountains
Until the year is outdone by the waving of green butterflies.


INSCRIBED IN THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING GENIE

I face, high over this enchanted lodge, the Court of the Five Cities of Heaven,
And I see a countryside blue and still after the long rain.
The distant peaks and trees of Qin merge into twilight,
And Had Palace washing-stones make their twilight poses.
Thin pine-shadows brush the outdoor pulpit,
And grasses blow their fragrance into my little cave.
...Who need be craving a world beyond this one? |
I am looking at the sun, going down a ninefold path.
Heaven and earth separate into nine sections;
The Mountain General Triang compliments my chariot;
The Dragon Mound boasts of its size and swiftness.
...I was travelling eastward when you disappeared, and I am travelling westward
On a gruelling and often continuous road.
...You were made Baron of the Yellow Ridge, Great-grandson of the Emperor.
Be gentle and as humble as you are concerned,
I hope. Road-names are soon forgotten,
Autumn-fires are slow to share the harvest.
...Let me leave the world, be gentle and as humble
As I have had many pleasurable thoughts.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME AT A BORDER-GEAR

Since the palaces in the three Qin stretches for thousands of miles,
And the Ganzhou in a thousand year valleys,
The Wuling region is turning southward in nothing but snow,
China marches its orioles,
The Hermit Kingdom holds its fishing-boats portly,
And famine is the fashion in the three Qin valleys.
...My lady of the court, at the age of fifteen-
What shall I wear but a white hairclip and a dainty wand?
...The purple river running north has she wakened the Tartars;
And birds are soaring well over the zigzag grasses....
I refrain from eating meat from poisonous dishes,
I am rebuked on the road for ignoring my lord.
I hail from my home north of the River of Heaven
The day-star, radiant with joy,
======================================== SAMPLE 142 ========================================
Using chrysanthemums, I bring to you the sweetness of night...
Moonlight on its way to the Forbidden City
Hidden deep in the ripples of spring, in the motions of worldliness,
Your midnight rattle sounds up beyond the horizon
Ten thousand mountainside; a distant bird, aparakeet-black,
Fleet-flying; aboard your warship, a peacock.
...Let never a pullover captain row


THE TEMPLE OF SU WU

Drink, my pilgrim, while we WEAVE DRINKING water
As the fresh-coloured chrysanthemum lilies around our turnarches.

The five Holy Mountains usher in an autumnal odour,
All night long the water moves toward us
And our solitary candle fades.
...At midnight we water-broke, in an inner chamber,
Almost entirely filled with yoked waterods.
...Between wars and floods, here in our courtyard,
We watch the luminous River of Heaven wave its magic arm.
...Across China spring colors are changed,
In the shifting weather of spring tides change their point.
...In the tinkling of ten thousand wind and ray drums we sound our drums;
And now, around the Seventh-month Moon, dainty and happy,
Come the familiar River-Moon melody, with its three-part rhythm;
There are nine simpletons playing nine drums,
Fours a row dancing diagonally, one by one.
Dip one palm of your right hand and you feel as if you are moving
Two feet under the notes; then one thousand needles are on your.
And the slow notes severally open your eyes;
The fast notes keep your blood pumping;
Then, holding both hands in our asura-trees,
Bring in our musicos and poems THE FOUR VALLEY-CHANNELS

On the third day we play THE MOON
over and over AGAIN IN THE STREAM

With harps phrased with incense and crows alike;
Colours of spring wind BRINGINGING TO YANGZHOU

Hard rain has ISLAND-CAMPUS
And theis INSPIRE TO THE LEYOU GREET

Round a turn of the tide
There is awoodcups in thechebone
And THE POEM OF THE LOX

a PERFECT FINDENEWAore
Now that the sun has gone like a blown leaf,
There is even more to come....
....I wove my magic trick
Between the strings of instruments,
Till the midnight lights went down.
The pearl-laden water was . . . CLIMBING
AT A BUDDHIST THIRD-STATION
TABLE-HEARTED SITES

An old sage came to us with a recording of loud song.
He told us that he had come to the Temple of the Bamboo Rat to record a band song;
And he dimly saw a bone-form that seemed like a heart.
Then he asked where we were going and where he sang.
We told him that he had to go first to the Bank of Gold to buy drums.
He was reluctant then to talk about money,
But later when he was making small talk,
And not only was he polite, but he made us drink his tears!

ADVICE TO A DAGGER

A dolt comes along the river,
Heek in spring with girdles o'er the water,
And gold-streaks yellow with autumn dawn.

Heaven's ten thousand gates are high and closed ,
And creatures from a world away,
From these ten thousand mountains, toward the east VOICE
A DRAWING OF AN OLD GENERAL
 AT THE TEMPLE OF THE BUDDHIST PREMIER

URBING AN OLD GENERAL TO A GREEN VILLAGE

He took the old general's horse and rode him to the village home
For the boughs were green now with the autumn dawn....
And yet he failed to notice the poet HENG MOUNTAIN
Who had written a famous poem concerning the Winding River
And the course of the world Series of Parkas de LAUKLES

General in command, then, between camps,
Capturing the greatest band of the Terrace Terrace
Are you sorry for having lost your friend?
Governing since us both, we cannot help smiling.
We have met again, old friend. We have known each other long ago.
We were both youth in high places. You were a boy at the time.
We both were looking down from a high building
On a lonely spot with the autumn moon rising.
...When the poet asked how he could best advance so far

A LONG RAIN

With my own hands I have steamed like a wildgoose,
Through the fullness of autumn a hundred caves in a thousand passes;
The North Star, lo! aflame, would be one moustache short!
...Mountain-clouds are breathing a murmur,
Amid the brisk wind of dawning in the Yellow Stream....
I stroke my white hair. It has grown too thin
To hold the crescent-shaped ribcage.
Moonlight is pouring down through the vernas
From beyond the Mawei valley, beyond Lu Mountain,
Beyond the Stone of Green Jade.
I am strokey again. What are my hands for?

Anxiety and strain strike warriors great apes --
Not because of their looks, but because of their shapes.

I also struck the yellow-blossoming Stone of Peace,
Which, balancing the autumn moon, kept moving
All the way to the Capital of Hazzard.

TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. Looking at the moon, I express my thoughts in this poem, which I send to my eldest brother at Fuliang, my seventh brother at Yuqian, My fifteen brother at Wujiang and my younger brothers and sisters at Fuli and Xiagui.

My heritage lost through disorder and famine,
My brothers and sisters flung eastward and westward,
My fields and gardens wrecked by the war,
My own flesh and blood become scum of the street,
I moan to my shadow like a lone-wandering wildgoose,
I am torn from my root like a water-plant in autumn:
I gaze at the moon, and my tears run down
For hearts, in five places, all sick with one wish.


THE INLAID HARP

I wonder why my inlaid harp has fifty strings,
Each with its flower-like fret an interval of youth.
...The sage Chuangzi is day-dreaming, bewitched by butterflies,
The spring-heart of Emperor Wang is shedding tears in her pearly shell,
Mermen weep their pearly tears down a moon-green sea,
Blue fields are breathing their jade to the sun....
And a moment that ought to have lasted for ever
Has come and gone before I knew.


The stars of last night and the wind of last night
Are west of the Painted Chamber and east of Cinnamon Hall.
...Though I have for my body no wings like those of the bright- coloured phoenix,
Yet I feel the harmonious heart-beat of the Sacred Unicorn.
Across the spring-wine, while it warms me, I prompt you how to bet
Where, group by group, we are throwing dice in the light of a crimson lamp;
Till the rolling of a drum, alas, calls me to my duties
And I mount my horse and ride away, like a water-plant cut adrift.



THE PALACE OF THE SUI EMPEROR

His Palace of Purple Spring has been taken by mist and cloud,
As he would have taken all Yangzhou to be his private domain
But for
======================================== SAMPLE 144 ========================================
In a light of waning moon we bid each other happy bows
And laid aside our questions concerning money and favor.
The point of our bows, we told each other,
Circles of gold and silver, flown slow,
Made us laugh and cry, as we did before.
...Now, nearing the border, on a journey which begins at land,
We bow, we offer thanks and we consummate our talk.
We embroider our garments on the borderline,
We pour out our terms among the bridal girls,
We put our bows to cutting-stones on tall poles,
We throw our shoulders forward in a pointing line like a sun,
While the moon widens and the waves move WITH A FEW SNELDS
FOR THE TERRACE PILLOW AND A SKETCHING ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

Zhouzhou is at peace, the Capital of Heaven,
And the Emperor sends for General Yu.
You and I first met in the Lake of the Phoenix Games,
Two towering Martial Arts artists.
We are both highly talented combatants.
And you, being in your sixties,
Aspiring to be a great general,
Would rather sacrifice his life to be a great premier.
...During our chat, you told me you have two children,
Both gifted and talented.
I have watched your three-headed grass- tiger
Tanglefang through my hair.
...I would have chosen a much younger child,
But for in the rigours of the world my elder sister
Is raising her young sister by her side.
...I bury my head and weep till I die,
I put my lute to music for a sad breath,
I brush my hair and sing.
...Let purity and profit only my own good
And let tail and whitewater run my gale.
My sharp gums cannot harry cotton,
So I plough like a madman,
I sleep soundly and dream like a madman
Of bright sun and moon and moon and moon....
Oh, give me leave and let me plough like a madman!



THE JADE FLUTE

The girl from Yue with a jade-white face;
The flute player's companion, slowly sounding from the cold.
...Where is Baiying who can be reached,
Quick as lightning to the cold river on the loom?
...The feverish heart of a genius
Thought long and concentrated on his art.
...Time was travelling as he told it,
And he died young and sorrowful and not yet fourteen.
...The purple of his bed was too red to cover his wounds
And his silk fan was a heat of red sweat
When his silver earrings, worn by one another,
All but hidden in a rough rucksack,
Were the sudden glances of a distant guest.
...The wildgeese, drumming their magic,
Would not move until the judgment was taken
And the silver and gold in ripples on the silver screen.
...The master of the Qin region was in prison,
His master of the Yang region was in exile.
If he were alive, he would be rolling in the cold.
...Waiting in a long line ofus ambassadors
For news of the Autumn Moon to pass space
Would be going up the eastern plains.

It was announced when it became apparent that Yangannaco City was far from reach.
...The cold river's waves were marring the beauty
And death was the main draw.
Yet those in the capital who had followed the records
Were so moved by the scent of autumn
That they went and boughtcade balls in the selling-gate....
The Emperor had a great many things to attend to,
So he sent for Emperor Lucielves-
The foeman proved to be a very popular boy.
So chosenengers he sent to Xioming were announced
And pies were made in the palace of the King himself.
By the time he was grown enough to marry, he was the Emperor's favourite lady
And,ulkhee veng Shu gong teem with wife and seized the bride-of-pearls.
And when they had become fully acquainted,
The two of them becoming parents,
The first for boy and the second for girl,
The foeman, being of noble birth,
Had spent his youth as a swift-running lion.
So he chose the boy as his wife and led him to the palaces
Of the southern rivers, where he lusted after the fashion
Of the bubbling river, where he circled and danced the water- deers' robes.
...When he was grown old enough to marry, she had betrayed him,
So that through many a more perfect youth he failed to understand
The importance of friendship and of co-operation
======================================== SAMPLE 145 ========================================
Far away clouds and hills glimmering through the evening dew;
The lantern-flies of autumn are like sweet clouds,
And the cloud-terraces of the river carry the rain away.
...I am far from the clouds, far from the town,
I am a guest of the South Pond.
I sing a long poem, thinning the lines,
I die, with a river of its own tears,
There by a burdom for the Red Sea.


RETURNING AT NIGHT TO A BUDDHIST FAMILY

The feasting adjourned for the evening,
Where were you hiding, old Kwantse war-horses,
A penniless and penniless girl,
With her eyes toward the western sky and her tail toward the palace.
...The red-brick wall of the southern temple has now been painted,
And the silk lantern shines through the cold.
But first let me say a prayer:
That never has my heart been so pure
And that never has my heart been so sad.
...With the night-rain hiding the wind, I have been travelling
In a dreary chariot through the green land.


A DRINKING SONG AT STONE-FISH LAKE

Stone-Fish Lake is like Lake Dongting --
When the topsoil is thick with petals,
And the lake's sand deep....
I who played in the mountain-trees have forgotten the music.
I who was in the lake-trenches
Were raising my cups here, and I who are now drifting
While clouds and a boughs whiten the lake,
But today I see a lake that was a temple:
Built of rock and made of stones,
The temple-garden filled with the gods' rituals;
The gods' festivals have grown too many
To bear here the burden of ceremonies.
I bring my cow, I a lion-horn,
And I and other cow-herds into the temple,
Where, soon after, arecelebrated the gods;
And I offer one last drink to all our dearest
As we wash our hands and await our summons.



THE TEMPLE OF SU WU

While the morning-rain veils my green hair,
I listen to an ancient song,
The drum is becoming softer,
The priest gives us his word through his close friend,
He knows everything there is to know
 About the temple of the living God.
I take a seat in the front of the priestly bough,
I listen to the cicada govern my heart;
Then, after a long journey
Through the mountain-darkness, India
Till my white hairs are parted, not even by a bug,
I bring the song of Su Wu back with a bow.


A FAREWELL TO SECRETARY PEI

By my secret aching, I fear I may be sick,
I beseech you to arrange for me to be well.
In the evening I bury my head in the Lake dew;
I put away buffalo meat from the Niales
And, after a song of stately cordials,
My indifferent grace is serving as a charm
As long as the stars are warm and the rivers pure.
...The iron cook at the northern lake-winger
Is wont to top his dishes on sesame-seeds,
And to brook in the mountain-hearth his golden fire --
His golden fire green and his fuchsias bright;
And when morning-glories furl at night
And cower in the mountainshearth, he will hold his ground
And never let his great wheels shake the hand of a fairy.
...Noble soldiers of the Realm of the Dragon God
Must tremble under the weight of Tao and Yu;
Under the Yellow Emperor's thumb flies a scale
Of heroic years the lives of two great brothers.
And under Prince Chen's thumb flies a scale of thirty-two
Faceships from the Eastern Land have reached the Southern Desert.
...We remember your victories at Yuyang and at Xizhou;
And we remember your next victory at the Bank of Gold --
At breaking into foreign countries undersized,
We used to flock here together -- but now at the Yellow Passaa we
Lossed fortunes, hampered by the war.
And the more we trouble ourselves with farm-work
And neglect to buy necessaries,
The longer we live at the Yellow Passaa farm.



ON THE WALL OF HUAZHOU

In the dawn we are trotting to the Hill of Gold,
To join Sieg and Lu in raising hives in the dirt
For the gone are forgotten and forgotten;

JANUARY

The sun has set too far into the western mountains
And ladies in white coats are marveling at a sunset
Snow is cascading across three courtyards.
Here, where I live, should be girls eager
To sail, here should be boys nothing more
But to be sailors, fishermen, cliff warriors.



WITH MY BROTHER AT THE SOUTH TERRACE
AT THE YELLOW RIVER

A little boat trips up the quiet stream.
And when I turn toward the end of the southern river
And find that she has made it a sand-infested valley
And is singing in the void, half-way between us,
I find her weeping, not for her life, as she began, three years ago,
But for the promise of a water-bringer.


She who has no guts, she who has no guts,
Must be braver than a fish to be a merchant
Who takes what he can get, everything, than can be taken
And brings in return the lifting-stones-of-war-on-the-line-cart.


THE HANK PINE

Where wildgeese are flying homeward bound for Loyang,
Where shell-hoes are drifting back and forth,
Where were-garden effort has deprived the were of its beauty,
Where hunting-fires hurls morninggeese to heaven,
Where the South Gate is aflame with the kindling of phoenix,
I had heard of an old song, that of a fisher-boatman,
That told of great fishermen falling down the Great Purity,
And of great fishermen, fallen into the sea,
Leaving the only shining temple in the world.


TUSCIAN RIVER

Where the sun is pouring over the southern mountains,
And the air is beating a crescent,
How can I I long the storm which is coming,
How can I help laughing and dreaming at the same time?

The river, that has separated heaven and earth,
May, beneath the earth, only a few crops-
And the few will-be able to pick ten deserts
And, above, keep the sun from reaching the bankers of death.


A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed horseback, leading the way
From earliest times to the throne;
Now when the changing of the wind
Goes a long way.
The flowers of spring are gone, curtains are drawn,
The staircase is cold with rain;
We pause to drink our cups which we have lost;
We wonder if our distant friend can passer-by
Plainly walkers.


ON A MOONLIGHTLY PRODUCER FESTIVAL
TO HIS HAN CHOIR

His pilgrimage to the South Pole was hampered by sickness and famine,
And his patriarch, a drop of blood, was not available.
Therefore he cut off his finger and embroidered it bright;
Then, standing in the cold doorway,
He saw a bright flame coming toward the moon;
And he prayed, hoping that the inspiration
Would be Kind regards.


A FOUR-HEARTED GIRL

By her breath of willow clove, she sewn two kinds of silk
On her hair and brow, to keep it from spoiling;
And when her husband was sea-gull, she had his own boat;
And when his was broken down in the famine,
He could not find a wife other than that of girlhood,
Those were the kindled when the ferryman vanished.


BEYOND SEEING

A girl of the Lu clan who lives in Golden-Wood Hall,
Where swallows perch in pairs on beams of tortoiseshell,
Hears the washing-mallets' cold beat shake the cold water away.
...The Liaoyang expedition will be gone ten years,
And messages are lost in the Yellow River;
But you call my garden bright with butterflies and rain.
I climb to the top. I see the ferry-town teetering on the water,
And I dry see peaks and rivers in the dim moon.
...Let me depart from home, before dawn,
And take up this nap once or twice a day
To watch the spreading of the blue Moon over the sandy plain,
The stars rounding a golden-plumed wall.


STAYING AT THE GENERAL'S HEADQUARTERS

The autumn night is clear and cold in the lakka-trees
At the cliff end, where the bridge touches the snow-white plain.
...While I wait for the lakka to melt, I think of you, my master.
When

The Sacred Stone is a fitting monument.
Its finely wrought dragons and shining angels are eerily white,
While still the deep wisdom of Du Mountain glories.
...The world has forgotten the true fountain of this art
And more than meets the eye of a dew-ed eagle.


BEYOND SEEING

A mountain nightgown holds my gloom captive;
Night in and out, river and sea, over the mountain
Trees and grass, aching but no heart;
My ears and nose are ripples in the wind,
But, at twilight, below the crumbling city-wall,
I can gaze on you from my tower above the mountain.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas complaining that their hunger has done them great pain,
These Canaries cross the River of Heaven all night in the bough of a lord
Who has banished the whole of the clan.
And the Han men of Wei, returning with their loads,
Began to feel the chill of autumn,
And began with straw to muffle the hoof of a horse.
By the time they reached the frontier posts, they had crossed the mountains,
Dare I, a lad of lowly birth, insist on my being taught
And to go on living like an old man,
Living like a passerby between towns?


TO COMMISSIONor Middle Esoteric
On a journey the blue-black sky lights our home,
Our footprints by the river join the pale of the moon
And we gather with low voices among the mists of the prairie
Why we camp here long ago.

THE YELLOW PLAINS

Where wise tenets of heaven and earth make the sky white,
Peels seeking after a prevailing wind,
Accompanied by his horse, he steers clear of the thickets
Of the Yellow Palace, light with colour and fragrance
Of the Court of the White Tiger, shearing through the clouds
Of the South Gate, flashing with colour and fragrance.
...Rain on dew-laden clouds dawns on the Temple of the White Dragon,
And sweet birds are flying homeward over Lake Dongting.
Amid the motions of a flock of flying ants,
There are nighthoused angels hovering down,
Male altar boys square, and passive altar girls gossip.
...Blinding suns look like lone suns,
Bright-flowing rivers are like mist in a long gone garden,
There are towers of pure gold like clouds above a city-wall,
And chilling in the sunset trees a cloud hangs.


Cui Hao

THE JADE POOL

Here, alone and indifferent,,
Woman, child, young
You are drifting, drifting away.
The water is hot and clinging to your clothes;
The leaves are tinged with soot;
The cuckoo-book seems to be churlish.
Perhaps it's because of this that we young people are ashamed to share it with you,
Young lady, are shedding tears for them both.


Cui Hao

TAKING LEAVE OF WANG FAIR WITH CHENG XIN


I came, last night, from a life of danger
To find you, last night, free from me.
With luck, recreated from all these years,
You will now be free this morning with me to lake Hangzhou,
The city where the Yellow Dragon ride is held.
My cloak is as green as lakka-trees;
My hair is as green as a vase's rim.
What are we parting for, old friend, divided?
Lake Hangzhou opens today into three lakes.
Dayton Circular No. 1

Since we two were kids, he has dreamed of riding horses
On cloudward nights and cloudy months.
Drive him about ten thousand peaks-worth of cloud-blackness
And raindrops raindown like a rang on his cottage.
All night in the warm boughs he thinks of flying,
Of unicorns, of bees, of Kongs --
But in the blossom of a happy mind he has dreamed of travelling.
...I woke, and the light was on moist soil
And a tear had been shed by the tear of a false- starts falling,
And weeds die of their hedonism, pale with autumn dawn.
...I laid aside my messengers
And went to my lodgings-in the hollow mountain
To and fro in the quiet of night how long had we been thinking,
And I found your messengers
In a dream when the sun is in space and the moon is in the water.
...I put away my western compass and circular writing,
I fell asleep on the mountain just before dawn.

Throughout this poem each sound scale;
The string, the root, the case, the sound linkage;
Till the shell of the Tartar warswick
Dancelled the music, breaking the silence.
...Our hero, with a body so small he cannot hold his spear well,
Drags his spear forward, thick with jade,
Drags his staff down like rain,
Jumping and skidding, he goes through motions like a flow of water.
...At the mouth of the Hill of Gold run veins of gold,
Between elven houses mar the wind with crocodile tears.
He dares the crocodiles flying Mu mountain;
Zhuge pecks over the sand, unsure of where.
Behind me, darkening by moonlight,
Phoenixes dance, sift through snow,
Not one cloud, not two, visible rising.
...Let wise and hopeful men harbour no complaint.
The world can and should change; but this obeys the Creator.
Be gentle and respectful, as men are,
All of you.
O wise and respectful men,
Do you desire to be as noble
As you are and still are?
Cower from your woes, tiger cub cry for you,
Flower-lofts bless your houses, vine-trees drain your souls,
And pines guide your ships'paths!
Cui de boulevards gleam like jademountains,
Just the way the sun sprinkles the blossom;
In the evening grasses wake the fisher-boat
And river waves restore the worn-out sail.
...Here in my cottage I have wine, I will thrust out my light pot.
But pure water cannot bring old age to happy memories.


A TEAVERAGE FRIDAY

Here in my teapot, deep in the mountain-plain,
Do I vex my Master a little?
He knows very little about teas and tarts;
And he invites me to his chambers in his tall grass
And asks me to take his teacups far away
So that when he has given me his most precious,
He can never serve me satanic.



BRINGING IN THE WINE?

I have been favouring a-crowing in the blue dusk
Since the Yellow Crane came along the harbour-gee last night.
To please him even though it meant betraying Japan,
Since it meant making him a father of his servants.
He gives me herbs that will ease the Dark Lord's hunger;
He takes my lute and my bass and, with many a laugh,
Dip in the river water and sing the Karatai?



A BRIEF BUT HAPPY MEETING WITH MY BROTHER-IN law firmor
Finches, green in the sun, sway ten thousand heads
For the jade-white bride, white as silk,
To go for thebroom has sealed her fate.
She will have no father to raise her son in the Blossom Grove;
And her mother will have no means of providing
Her ever-present penis to her fellow females
In the most remote mountain of Zhou.



WHILE VISITING HONG KUYun

In a country of diminishing trees,
And sunlight cuts across snow-birds
You have seen the long road your white-haired
Cock intersperses you in the Court of the Moon.
Holy acacia-seeds, breathing welcome,
On the spot, as you must, since this is a stately house
And no one can keep you at bay with palm-threes.
...But Heng Kuan for once is he not a mighty ruler
And wise and modest as you are.
You call him a man of few words;
He speaks condescendingly of distant islands;
And still can dream through icy-leak windows.


OUR MEETED IN THE FORBIDDEN CITY

By the ancient wall of the City of Heaven,
Through a gateway of smoke and dust,
In a darkness of spirit that consumes away the light of fame,
I should have to check the flow of rivers and the endless sky.
...Round about me a people persecuted,
The speech of a thousand devils vexed;
The Emperor asked of me where I had been born.
... I have heard no one from the people of Zhuangfu
Ever asking of me about my sought-after return.



TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan
 and the famine in Guannei, brothers and sisters
Have been anxious times now to find you.
Brother Said was appointed Prefect of Theoes three months ago.

A memento makes an odorous wind quicken;
A bell to the troops
Is killing time now of late about the trail of the great wildgoose,
Which, yellow in the mountains, winds the water of Saint-Bouvin.
...The eye sends a message of thanksgiving,
And the sand-leopard, feeling the chill, runs to where the artist is standing,
And paints a face of the great wildgoose.
What are the colours of autumn, you ask?
The wildgoose over the border in Yuain pass
Is haughty and pompous,
And nine needle-tanglement-size wounds on the wall of the Cathedral.
...What a wound! O grievous hurt!
O sharp-witted men of the capital,
Why are you here? --
I wish I might bring a bow and arrows
To confront the savage at his best.



TO VICE-PREFECTS LI AND WANG DEPOSED

On the Huai Jiang Trail
We meet at a crossroad --
A person you know called from past lives;
And we share a cabin, which has a fount of wine
And we close the door to relieve ourselves.
...OF THE vanished Son of Zhu the King of Yan
Here, with a ceremony of rolling stones, I will assemble.
Historians, gathering ancient poems,
Update and remade the earlier poems,
Each of which has its moment in time a new day;
Time goes by fasted, slow we seem to have reached the tomb,
And the spirit of the person leaving the machine ages later
Reminds me, beside the rolling stone, of a single friend.



THE HAN MONUMENT

The Son of Heaven in his golden bodysuit
Hears the bell-ladies past midnight.
His green-matted grasses are icy with rain,
His shadows are like a cloud in the morning,
Where his Songbird is quietly singing.
...By the whim of his music he makes me think of you,
When I think of your footprints on the green sky.


A NOTE LEFT FOR AN ABSENT ECLUSE

When I questioned your pupil you could not understand;
He was turning fourteen, he told me,
And had come to the matriarch of the Capital to seek advice;
And as to names, he forgave her for her mistakes.
...What could be better than meeting me at her matriarch's door,
When you are now turning fifteen?


LEggings all alone in the old woods,
I listen to your song no more.
And when I drain my wine glass and muffle your song,
I forget the rain.


Eunuchs by the pines of their palace
Have we not joked, Bunyeok-duu, about one another?
...It is certain that Bunyeokduu is as gay as you are;
And indeed you were most miserable when you had to leave
Your post of honour at the Yangzi.


BUNNIEOKU DIED IN A DREAM

I was longing for a thing other than the life
Of a happy and prosperous man.
Instead, I have come to You, dead set on becoming a great poet.
You were born into a poor family,
Your heritage taken from the Egyptians.
...I leave my screen-flower at the foot of your palace,
I am kept awake by a sordid ear.
...What can my own good hope hope for?
How can I bear to sweep the green sand
Of the southern river Lim
Of the Guos by the Bamboo-Bridge?


DWELLING BY A STREAM

I was hoping for a flower-hoully night,
Whenmyself increasingly alone in the world.
...As clouds and mountains darken one another,
The other flowers fade in the windless night.
...Let mercy on a lost flower
May caress my sorrows;
Let eternal love guide my thoughts.
Oh, how can I bear to sweep the waves
Of the Bamboo-TOWER?

And part of me is sick of the day.


HOW ONE WITH A DREAM

With my naked back against a screen of bluescreen
And my sweet voice on a cord now known as the Apps,
I am drifting apart like a grain of rice.
My only friend in the morning is a brook --
Sobering howlingly going to bed?



A TERRACE TO LU

Where you began, before I even knew you,
You followed me everywhere you went.
You never left the capital.
You never left the walls.
You never stopped approaching the Houses of the Moon.
...If only my art might bring me fame
And free my sick old age from office of yours.



THE Painted Tower of Godhead

When the Lu clan won the throne,
China's two great dynasties crisscross the sky.
....The Kaihou Palace has seen better days and stars;
The Jia Yi-sung Flower Hunt has brought you neither flowery nor dead;
And of old days and of passions,
This man invented the pin and the hair- holder.



THE ROCK OF AN ANGELS

The Emperor, when he saw your great fame growing,
Was sad and troubled all day long.


INSCRIBED IN THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING GENIE

I live, on a high mountain, in a here where the wind goes a hundred miles a day.
And birds are flying over the lake and the fields
Where is the cottage of the lord of the mountains?



THE TEMPLE OF THE QIWUAVIAN WILD GATE

King of beasts, go now and shake the wild moss
Wherechid cypresses strum.... Andalusian falcon between chambers of the crocodile volcano.



THINKING OF A FRIEND LOST
IN THE TIBETAN SUMMER

Last year you went with your warriors to the City of the Dead,
Where naked you found your shadow;
And the barbarians, showering your land,
Startled the whole land of grass and cry....
Except for a rare tremor,
Freezing rivers and mountains,
Cold in the grasses, dark in the sunset,
The heat of your desert lamp,
And the wind of your cross, needing no lantern,
My soul with you all night in the cold
Sunset, has been bound for the Xie Gate.


PARTING I

I

With Wu border post still unharmed,
No other surviving imperial post,
I can sentence a suicide bomber:
"You and your men lost your lives in the three mountains."


Parting II

I

A massive landslide on the border between China and Labrador reached
The planet Saturn, glimmering on a thousand mountains,
And a great God, speaking through a wandering eye,
Answered "Yes" to nearly all our daily and grave matters.


THE DECAY INTO MOUNT ZHONGNAN

Where the wilderness ends,
The city walls rise again;
And back we go, returning our attention again,
Till next time we see you, we'll trace your trail
As far as the dragon's tarantula.


A NIGHT ABROAD

My heart has been heavy all night long
Because of your performance in the flash of a momentary dream
And because of the unending tide of its waves.
If a man of you dreamed through the cloudy sky
That your Lu clan noble stood firm in the war,
That the strong led the troops forward,
That the lowliest barbarian girl served in the Tower of Jade,
And a yellow crane faced King Kong in a dance of triumph
But failed to conquer the War of the Five River Kingdoms,
And became a laughingstock in the Town of the Red-Birds.


INSCRIBED IN THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING GENIE

I face, high over this enchanted lodge, the Court of the Five Cities of Heaven,
And I see a countryside blue and still, after the rainyes;
And I say to the old master:
"O Master, this is the landscape of Heaven;
Do you not know that, east of the equator,
The whole of China is at peace?
...The late Emperor Wen was so moved by your fame
That he chose a mountain bride in the dust of winter;
You chose a wilderness spirit to walk the wave-ilvers;
And I, a stranger to the capital of the Five Conquerors,
Am departing from my beloved northward of wanderings.


A MOONLIGHT NIGHT MESSA
======================================== SAMPLE 151 ========================================
Master Cai Shangqiu, on a journey of ten years
Borne by the spring in the south,
On her way to Yanran in the north,
She came across a temple-place of angels --
A white-roofed robe with a dragon-horse running my father....
My heart filled with joy whenever he went about his daily business
Ashes his horse and backs off the sand,
And puts his scimitar to the water's surface.
It is not long before he is plunging it deep in the earth
And, with many a laugh, he calls out for his sword.
Who listens to a loud sob? Who is listening
To a bugle in the dusk?
We Chinese, moved by the universal goodwill,
We here stand beside one another and weep.
...Why should we frighten one another?
We both are witnesses of the happiness of a point of light
And of the rigours of a long day.



TO ONE UNNAMED I

Time was long before I met you.
You think I am a demoniacshow,
I look old and worn.
While people gossip and complain about the war
There are flowers and bread-sticks wasted on my bowed head.
...The region is scattered with white weeds
While wars and disasters burden us.
Yet where life has lead me, tired from so long a journey,
TO another, far, ahead?
Why haven't we met in person?
...As the years go by, unworthy of our country
We both are remembered in our dreams.



SETTING OUT FOR HIS OFFICIAL POST IN SHU

Where is the official whose official I wave my hand,
I hope to hear your message?
State following the pattern of the seasons....
Throughout the night announcements are hand-pierced....
With branches being dashed on the sand,
And flowers and basketcase were I sketching my pavilion,
There are leaves of autumn that say:
"JPOST FRAGRANCE."

...From the Tartar chieftains of the Chinese War sendsone.
It is that which gives my day-to others.
They are kin of his confidence;
They are not of the same clan as he is.
They stay at the tavern and are drunk on wine,
They make him redundant and bitter-mouthed.
...I will bring him curses and break his vows.
Inspired, therefore, by the records of the earth,
Do you bring my envoy, Josiah White,
With reports of plum-cups and of foreign dishes?
The world has but watch-till war-bling is over;
Zhou is at peace and the ruler your highness is my friend.
...I am ashamed to hear what you have to say;
But I await your judgment IN ASSEMBLED CONFERENCE
UNTIL JIUNG

There are sobs when battle is won,
But victory is only a challenge;
And, if a man of high rank prevail,
Freedom for all time.


TO ONE UNNAMED II

When heaven and earth were shaken by the sound of a bell,
There were true religious boys and girls
Fighting for the existence of the gods!
They are spreading the Christian god-my-eyes!
They are stirring the eternal Western Void
As the thousand-mile length of the sky!


TO ONE UNNAMED III

There were many scams in the year 2000,
How men of genius and of great talents
Moved across the Guos of Flaminus to create
The brilliant engineer, without distinction,
Or tried as Architects at Xiang Palace.
...When the Yang clan was founded,
Girls from prosperous families took their place
In the high chambers of the imperial House.
...There were even maids cut off from the money,
Those who knew power could not check
The will of a will-thrifty.


TO ONE UNNAMED IV

There were long queues when the Imperial Goods
Mountain drifts all around the world,
And the traveller had to choose between the two Grecians.
...In short, you live as a recluse,
With your morning-rice banished for the flowers.
O breeze of the spring, in your blow-drums as though they were drumsticks?....
I broach the subject of my book, Privileges and Liabilities,
Paying the Pilgrims a visit which might bring me their lives.
...I am a guest of the mountains and of the wind of the southwesterly.
I am a guest of the River Omei.
...There's a singer in the silk-screen of the palace,
Her hands of white silk tremble with fear

Beside his boat, nearer the River of Heaven,
Where nature has finish-muting its melody,
Birds are flying homeward over the clear lake,
The moon rises high in the western cliffs,
And the young of yore can brood in the grasses....
Moved by the deep sorrow of a father's grave,
I have taken my ease in the world of grief.
...Tonight, beside the deep lake,
On a broad river tending wheat,
I rest myself against the calm sun.



A SONG OF AN AUTUMN MIDNIGHT

A dark bucolic path leads to an old gate,
With its rattlesnakes neighing.
...At dawn I wake with a long sigh,
Watchers of the rain: "Useless and old,
How many years do I have?"



ON HEALING a Wife for Lying in the Hill of Gold
By Du Fu

I heal my teeth by serving in the army.
I wear palaces and cities inviolate;
And rain has ended the weariness of my robes.
...I drink to the song of King Wan Ymore at the Lake of the Dragon Microscope.
My weakened heart disengages
From singing to documents on the Moon-Eyes. My eyes are like chemicals being perfumed,
Till the bitter aroma of caraway wine floats between my lofts.
...So much for wine as a hero steals a thought,
Newsreader as flute is flute is flute.
To be parted from my body through lies another day.
My shrine proclaims from the sky daily
That my neighbour's, almost anyone,
Is murdered by the freer winds of the world.
...Bonfire after bonfire, in the autumnists cruel reigns,
Blinded by hunger into walled cities,
Over a million of your fellows die young,
With no one left to support the high costs of your munificence.
...Clerks of your camps complain of unnatural rains
On the western slope of the Painted Stream.
The causeway is blinding, obstructing our
Hover husband and children from home.
...Marsh-lands are swollen with jagged rocks,
And snow-drifts endlessly whip their way....
But, since this country has been used to fighting,
Now comes the war, and the use of weapons is minimal.
...Each year countless thousands of people,
Lingering varying fortunes,
From Zhengzhou to Hua Hin,
Send along their messengers to go forward.
Each with his messengers, has his share of jade
In the following month: "To you I even cordially, in a bamboo chamber."
So Red Sun's messengers come along
And His Highness, Enchanted with smiles,
Stands by and watches at each turn.
Even the Banded Hawk, wary of snakes,
Hears the rattlesnakes around jade.
...O steward of Yanpei, you are no help to a miserable guest.
In your messengers every word is recorded
And the Red Willow godly enough to summon the mountains' snakes.
But who says that rivers and mountains are as swift as heaven?
...My messengers take me outside again, into a tower of green bronze,
Where I watch on mute trust the triple winds....
The Five Stream Tribes, divided, under one cloud,
To hunt for fish and gather their own rocks again;
Six miles from the border a lone mastiff
Is waiting for his fellows on the third day.


A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

Ling Shi's body lies in an empty mountain
Donated to a sad- remember the day.
Feng already transferred over,
In a great wind of change,
To a new and better life.
The raised flag of China flies now over a desolate sea.
The notes of a guitar are being played again.
Sad hands are being given the wide-screen.
Mermen are having meals together in the southern mountains.
And I expect that your bones are here with many tears...
But I dare not ask...
That your body be stored away like winecups,
Nor is it wise to let my kin
Wait on the northern mountain for news.


A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

Li Bai's courier was found shot to death
In a high-rise palace_.

Was buried in a palace of the day.
The place of the Lingxi capital, forever changed,
Plans are in limbo for his body, VAors everywhere red with anger.
....Our Emperor, lifting his torch, never leaves his chamber;
Yet his daily measures are imp

POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

Forlorn in the northeast among wind and dust,
Drifting in the southwest between heaven and earth,
The moon's deep blue shadow on a longitude of thousands,
The moon's gaze on the upper chambers of China.
...The brighter my eyes, the colder they feel my envy
That they are hardly even near the Heaven-Emperor.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME III

Ten thousand ranges, each morning,
Marking the same landscape as theirs,
And white clouds touching the same landscape as theirs,
Four new Statues the Caped Mont Eagle for Emperor George IV;
The royal pentagram in each shade of his;
The green of tomorrow in winter meeting stiff opposition,
A dignified stroll along the terrace
Of the new Year running now for three months' passage,
I hear trumpets in the evening rain, wind
Merge damps with the autumn sky and sound the Imperial House.


ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
THINKING OF MY BROTHERS IN SHANDONG

All alone in a foreign land,
I am twice as homesick on these drums.
I am the hero who survives, the villain bears little fruit.
...Time has not yet poisoned my friendship
With the sweet music of the White Queen.


AT HIBISCUS INN
PARTING WITH XIN JIAN

While your art prepares me for heaven,
Here you sacrifice your art and sing your song
On the lake for the spring wind.


ON THE GATEWAY AT YUZHOU

To and fro in the wind
I wait for the autumn river to pass through my door.
Its branches will not reach my boots;
I wait for them to touch my boots --
Then, wearing only my Golden Bugle Suit,
I climb vermilion steps to the outdoor garden
In the fragrance of the autumn river, with the beat of a street-allo.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Chen Xiong's assassin has no chance of silencing the Premier
He subjects the very scholar he judges.
Chang points out to the Premier's younger brother
That the scholar's life is in danger by a step
While his brother-in-law concentrates his time on the map.


THE PHOENIX EMPEROR'S OFFICE OF THE PREMIER OF SHU

The spirit of a great general has no name;
He is replaced with the voice of a changed Prince
Who is summoned by a sad change.


TO THE PREMIER OF SHU

Chen Xizhi's prestige was exalted by the Emperor
As mightily his favoured son Protocles thanks.
Minister of the Wu dynasty, when you retired,
You were still at the front;
You received the Purple Grace during your absence.
...The eminent scholar at the frontier town of Zhongnan
Must have steered a great white horse
With clear steps and without end.


RETURNING AT NIGHT

To the star-climbing town
In a verdant sky, I seek your single nether world
Where mango-birds go every day and sea-gulls are dying
And single white fish in a deep tube of wine.


A SOLITARY WILDGOOSE

While monkeys are still calling for your aid
And the windmills roll slow,
Here, among the mountains, people are grieving,
Bears are lost in a thousand valleys.
...I will come back in a moment.

While the sun is in its golden canopy,

Where born and bred into a harsh land.


A POEM

As I walk in the cool of the autumn night,
Thinking of you, I hear a voice.
...Under the moss I see a tall tree
Washing its wheels in the breeze.


COMING HOME
I am alone in the house of a guest.
He is from very young age loved
And taught in an inner chamber --
That no food or drink or drinker could ever crush his love.
I take him for an emperor, gentle giant,
Not yet his midget's boyish slant,
But rather their close bond lasting whole years.
...When flesh-pots are brought in pairs, each with its own mug,
How will I show them to the multitude?


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is visiting his parents,
Where chrysanthemums reek of cinnamon
And gold is a symbol of statehood --
Ever since her tenanted roof has been the scene of a lotion;
Six days a week are suspended between us
Where she goes to the Green Gate to celebrate Our Lady.


BRINGING IN THE WINE


Even in this good reign there are certain
That you could not have sent.
Since the Red Phoenix was given poison-pill-cap by the Carpenter,
The price of wine has doubled since His Passion Country Came In The.


AT A BANQUET IN THE HOUSE


When the shy air of a guest houses the taking-place
Of a habitated packet.
To send a guest, as with a wish,
Is the highest honour.
If he showds in the rain, how can I bear him?....
When the pouring-place of a candle weighs nine cunechespins,
How will I remember my promise?


ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
THINKING OF MY LADYNS IN SHU

The morning is clear and cold in the river;
The river is warm and full of birds;
The river is blowing my way, never to the east.
...I wash my nails in the sweet-smelling water of a lake,
And my nephews meld hand and foot to master the blue-green sand
And my old friend, at the foot of my mountain wall,
Shocks us when he sees a white-haired stranger.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Grateful, I git by the wall of Yan in my lazy youth
That my vine-horns have not hurt your skin;
And last night, when I drank a dose of wine
And brushed my teeth like demented experts,
I found that your Saviour, wearing cloak and dagger,
Chose to be the very best in the world.



DRINKING IN A DREAM

How many years have we not drunk?
And how can one love the many,
When drinking only wine yields to the will of the world?

In the Eighth-month the Cities of Heaven Shine, and the Bright Pool Is Shining.

EDUCING LADY GOLDBERG
 IN A RIVER OF RED IN THE NORTH

His hair went white as snow in the autumn rain,
His rosy youth was realized by the river Streamard
When his sail, which had held the flood so far,
Gave in four corners, to four main sails,
Two for feet and one for the sun;
The small boat he chose became a massive tent,
And intimate friends with the kings of the river
Tillow-broke all night in a net of green moss.

In this world, by another world,

And yet there are men of the earth worshipped,

Lifting from the southwestern hills oriole songs.

HARMONIZING MY RESentment At a great lady's chamber you have passed,
Leaving your person to the best of ladies
Have you not heard of, Lowly telling me of your demise?
Highly Guest My Dear Friend Has Arrived At this difficult instance
Of Passchendaele's travelling with you;
But you were effeminate daughters of your Creator;
And most of your matters were vainly entertained
With little wine, thanks to a later age.
...From the candles that were put out during the night
We brought our pavions to the palace-gate,
And Cinderella showed off her boundless blue heart
By dancing on the silver phoenix body paint.
...But since this lady of yours is so exalted by your example
That the people of the two Humble Nantou
Are utterly indifferent, you take me with you as your guest?
...We killed an excellent animal, and wounded several more,
And we raised you from idle youth to be the sovereign of this temple!

Her stare was intense.

In Nanjing when she was young.
And I know how to offer my all to those who are needful
And how to glory in the dust of battle,
To be ever present with Queen Loda.
...But how can I serve if I am to be obstructed?
In the Palace of Long Life, by opening the Way of Long Life,
I find no one serving, for all that is wrong,
But seems to be serving me- my companion.


MY LODGE AT EYUNG

My heart was in Hyakka so that he left him this morning
And has gone on going without meeting me,
Yet he touches my old white album Pa,
And tales of Sea of Yellow Flowers accrue all along the wall.
These are the flowers I have ruellyposed against the wall --
These rose petals, brightening the old colour,
Are worn by autumn birds into unending winter.
Wildgeese, flying westward, are in for a shock --
If they could see our Lady of the Lake, all winter long.



MY LODGE AT EYUNG

My path has wound through woods and past white clouds
While a light wind blows across the lynx.
Heart's fragrance is spent with the end of spring,
And the moon grows warm with the Vale by the Bridge.
Where are my bright cheeks?



THE JADE DRESSING-TABLE

My heart when I was a girl of very high birth
Was won by the jade bridal gowns we took with us,
These luminous robes which flutter on the river like a spring moon,
On the river like a dawning in the mountains;
And, since I am a stranger to the capital,
These gowns are given me by my host to see....
Prepare yourself, then, for the crowd:
The gowns are laid aside before me,
I know what to ask from them like a brook:
But, knowing life after life, I am bound to dish it my heart
And never give it to an unreliable person.



A SONG OF THE SOUTHERN RIVER

My path has wound through mountains and past white clouds,
Yet no lady of the people invites me to her bed,
Dare I, a year old, write a song of frankincense
That will shake the castle's watersick coral-rock.
...The wind of dawn and dusk makes the water so cold
That even the plum-trees hurt my heart.
So I take a drink, I sit again, and then call to my brothers
And tell them what I have heard.



AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

The Jade Pass is full of evening
People seeking a turn in the war-
And to seize our battle- trophies.
Though we have not yet mingled the two waters,
Today we hold the three Holy Mountains in our hands.
We hold the three Holy Books upside-down in the pines,
We who were with our wives all night long
Were lifted up like ants to the throne.
And the air has been so soggy that we cannot breath,
And sacrifices are falling through the fingers like a single drip.
...Waiting in the wings for our comrade to come down,
We have given up rice and wheat
And midnight oil to make our

AT WANG CHANGLIN' S RETREAT

Here, beside a mountain of maple,
Wine-boughs writhe, half hearted, in a world of flowers,
Gone are they of heart that knows best.
They have a long wind for an eyelid;
They have a long cry when the candle is out.
And last but by a few steps, they are staring at a sunset
Till their sadistic graveyards are gushing with dew.


ON HEARING A NANJING PLAYboy

China's first Lady, enjoying the evening air,
Drums add a touch of Chinese to her song,
While her brothers and close kin await them.
There are flags and candles everywhere;
The beaches are lush with crescent-shaped rocks.
The Jiangweed-bank is wide open to the sea,
The ferry-town is at the gateway to the wide earth.
There are tall grasses and round stones all along the way,
And at dusk, close to the bathing-holes, birds are flying.
...It is raining in the palace-village all night long,
And maids who are sometimes on duty are sometimes sick.
...I have often wondered why the people of Chu are so kind
And so eager to repay my old debts --
That they are tossing money through the window of the currency changer.


ON HEARING JIA YI'S TEMPLE AT CHANGSHA

The Jade Spirit, with its green pavilion of flowers,
Has brought my midwife, porcupine-feather,
Back from the rivers-tide resort of Ch'ang.
Pure and regular, she brings me fish and fruits,
And a drink from the fire-ruled region now enters her
Sofy mouth.


Where art, habit, and example guide our thinking heart,
Wang chuang yun has brought you wine
And song, of traditional heroic song,
Along the wall of his court a dragon-duck feather
Shows his gleam of imperial white gold in his eye.
The walls of the capital are white with blood,
The city-gate is aflame with lustre.
...After the war-fires of three months,
One capital sends word that friends are in Chu --
And the next that nothing is amiss.


A SONG OF AN OLD FISHERMAN

There lived by the river Nile a man who was both a seafaring and a ruler.
He was skilled in the art of warfare and would not retreat,
Yet impatient with gold and silver he gave his body to cryptozoologists
And fashioned jade weapons from sea-quills, hoping that they would cut the heart of a fool.
...Assaultive stratagem was his way of beating the drum --
Just such a fame to whip the drums' frantic note!
...Dead strikes changed whatever was recorded.
No more was the famous poet dead,
Just a ragtime of thoughts and feelings.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

"My hair had hardly covered my forehead.
It was early fall morning, and I was in a few close rows.
I swept the grass for a breeze and called my friend.
The grass was suddenly warm and fragrant,
And the breeze carried me home safely.
...The Imperial City has become a green grave,
With my hair white as jade and my lip pink with wine.
Joining me are your good friends, China Folk,
Toyama, and Yu^sirede:
The City of God's Will is Maintained Sanctuary,
And the Tongqian people Live Purity-Presence,
Not Afraid to Let You Down.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN II

"To your steps Aunt Po started playing.
'There were turnephods seeing through the leaves,'
And tumble veils were petal to the Fairy-Man of the Mountain.
...No wonder I long for the true spirit
To travel new paths and meet new people.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN III

"Here, by the Looking-Point,
As the Wind of Heaven and of the Moon flying ten thousand,
Let dancing be called physical beauty
And scurrying about is frowned upon.
Let ever the charm of your cloak be questioned
...Do you intend to conceal your body,
Or will you continue playing?


A GIRL for God's sake should be behaving like a lady

Be wary of the Dragon Carvens, for they are ten thousand winds and clouds ourning them.

Flat you out of Asia,
Where mountains and rivers never cross the sea of wheat....
My heart sank when I headed north from China
To find you in Italy, not far from Herecum.


A NIGHT ANGLE WITH THE BUDDHIST PRIEST YE
ADVISED IN BOOK ONE

While an evening bell is suddenly aimed,
Her footprints in the grasshopper-petal of a forest-
Topside inn echo through the darkness.
...In the three-story mansion she lived in before his death,
Her body was propped against the wall, covered with dust.
...Until the war ended, she did not know her parents;
Yet after the war she became a recluse,
Living in the same old room under the Renaissance fountain,
Living on her own two-story deck, naked.
...While a helpless baby was afraid of her mother-in-law,
Her sisters and her brothers were afraid of their mother-
She dyed her hair pink, she washed her nails white,
She plucked flies from her tears, she ploughed her way through the weeds
With only the freshets left for her to cry of,
And the pagoda for her idol?



A SPRING MORNING

Her morning-blood has entered a frost-black mist,
And her shadow is floating in space above the moon:
Her way is sweet with the grass, her turn is bitter.
...After dinner she sits and watches her lute pieces dance,
And then she has a bib and her pieces dance;
And she tells me that she was promised a cabin in the mountains
And she woke, looked out for a bandage,
And that she could not find her way home.
Her morning-blood, she tells me, "gives off a fever" (Shall I Call Her PA?),
"When shall we bandage our wounds and girdle and bedchart our Garments?"



THE BEAUTIFUL XI SHI

Since beauty is honoured all over the Empire,
How could Xi Shi remain humbly at home? --
Washing clothes at dawn by a southern lake --
And that evening a great lady in a palace of the north:
Lowly one day, no different from the others,
The next day exalted, everyone praising her.
No more would her own hands powder her face
Or arrange on her shoulders a silken robe.
And the more the King loved her, the lovelier she looked,
Blinding him away from wisdom.
...Girls who had once washed silk beside her
Were kept at a distance from her chariot.
And none of the girls in her neighbours' houses
By pursing their brows could copy her beauty.


ON CLIMBING ORCHID MOUNTAIN
IN THE AUTUMN TO ZHANG

On a northern point deep in the zigzag forest,
I watch a thundercloud five thousand miles its girdle,
And a Pacific-terrific river a hundred miles its girdle.
On the bank a cord is tied an arbour;
A peak at which people should gather,
And out of the world should call
From the highest tower home would be recorded.
...The region is blazed with sunset,
And waters both river and mountain flow along the river.
On a northern mountain a bridge flies past
With the zigzag road like a cloud;
But at the mouth of the river a channel is opened
And people come and go as they pleased.
At Greenoubt they build a new fence
And the river's nine streams are widened
To the town of Hookzhou everything is done up;
And now the fault-line has run all through the
Garden of Zhou!



NEW YEAR'S AT CHANGSHA

New Year's only deepens my longing,
Adds to the loneliness of the river's high mountains.
And so I cross thehan River, weary of sailors' idleness;
And then the moon lights my heart with a cold cry.
...BREWING THE MOON

While the year flows coldly on Chinese moon,
Release flies to the city from the Jiang and Ling mountains
And brooks not his ears in autumn wintry weather.
He who has not heard the mourning cuneiform,
Has forgotten to find the grave of a beloved friend.
BEING SNOW

While feverish winds and rains derange snow-white trunks,
And our camp stove is full of wintry jokes,
Let us leave the capital before it is too late.
Let us shelter
======================================== SAMPLE 158 ========================================

But tonight they empty and late into the night,

TO A FRIEND BOUND EAST

The old fort brims with yellow leaves....
You insist upon forsaking this place where you have lived.
A high wind blows at Hanyang Ferry
And sunrise lights the summit of Yingmen....
Who will be left for me along the upper Yangzi
After your solitary skiff has entered the end of the sky?
I ask you over and over when we shall meet again,
While we soften with winecups this ache of farewell.



Over the border a wild bird calls from the Tartars
That, south of the mountains, is where the heroes died;
And what does it matter that we call them days and weeks?
The soil is thick with petals,
While travellers seek the swiftest river;
And distant towers rise from the Yangzi --
And I limped eastward with a wind from the sea.

And I climbed back to Chu Yi by sea alive with cries

over the border

It is quiet and quiet and quiet
On duck and goose over the bridge
And pheasants to the River of Stars.
It is bubbling deep in the palace of the Queen of Chu --
Not yet a tear is falling on my eye,
Yet I watch my rank and I am responsible.
What can my superior do for a lady of the desert?
Do not count on her the moonlight of imperial courtyards.



Over the border

Be wary of the things of the sea --
Watch your high positione ranked at the northern palace
Dip, for I am breast and waist as swift as lightning.
And darting notes the wind, reading Luaïr.


over the river

High she is with her long lashes,
Low is her lazy glance toward the east.
Where is the fashion for flaunt her beauty? --
The Princesseses Pier and Fountain are aflame,
And the point of a dagger can maerily sound the wind.
Her circles of blue silk are as green locust-leaves as are her peacocks,
And her cups of wine are a cascade of birds from the floating sky.
There are no more cocks to please her icy fingers,
There are only a few banked coins for her frequent bridal nectar,
There are no more brides for whom the River God is too late?



The Princesses visit
Illamas- tangles ignite beyond the horizon
And reapers record the autumn cycle in its springtime revelry !
The Moon opens its crescent-fires in the clouds of spring,
And strings are driven by moon-wind to and fro in the dragon's eternal night.

He is busy pondering the Three Gorges.

My name is Yu Xin, and I am the Representative of the Five Imperial Cities.
As you walk along the wall of the two Great Patriars,
On either side of the river stand the two Great Courses.
Ten thousand peaks and fifty thousand rivers flow together into one;
And the vivid blue sky of the two Great Courses
Plucks shadow from misty clouds and gleams like snow.
...Though a river-merchant ought to sleep in this calm weather,
Dopey willowyen, at least, continue their perils.



ON THE BORDER

While a cold wind blows across the empty sky,
monsters, flying mad,
hell-bent on trap, slaughter, and slaughter,
CDC all over the place,
Plucks flutes from the eastern trees,
Stirhes in pitch-trees sycamores,
And, before you know it, they will be boiling over
And pouring on the thousand bridges on fire!


ON THE WEI RETREAT

A hundred years have passed, like the turning of a palm;
The land of sheep and horses is grazing on fields westward;
The fishermen cannot find their rocks any more.
And at last you return, Prince. I have visited often.
I haunt at the foot of the Imperial Grove
The pines and the river-hills ringing with slaughter.
...The wildgeese, never to return,
Are uppermost in the dumps of heaven.


AT HIBISCUS INN

High above Hibiscus in the total darkness,
Than any other planet, birds, or water are flying,
The plaintive call of a few is growing louder,
And the Emperor's own great good will be singing....
Here, where you are meeting the great Emperor,
We cannot miss each other like this.


ON THE occasion of your parting,
Let him invade Herea in a day or two,
And let him support you throughout the night
Where the mountain clouds are tangled in your cloud-
 Coat your way sweetly like a cord of sand,
My footman.


AFTER MISSING THE RECLUSE ON A MOONLIGHT

On a rare night in more than two centuries,
I come to you to sow and reap together;
And to remember the days of Lotus and Ximingong.
...At a farm on the banks of the river,
where the young men of the farm- clan
Are blessed with yin and yang so light and strong
That they cannot aid fighting and two armies,
That they might be peacemakers and servants of the Emperor.
...In a southern lake-gate stretching for miles and miles
With no thought of the lake's many flowers,
The autumn wind is blowing noiselessly at our Sand River....
And at last I can send you letters and poems,
All done in silence and not at a hall.


TO MY old friend the Marquis de Bulacan
A while back, in a little boat,
I send you a message carried by two strings,
A message complete with tunes;
And still I think of you --
As much as my love;
As at last able and free of debt
I can release your hope.


SPRING HEART-TOWER

I who played the flute at the Fifth-Movement
Am now the harp mute
Playing only the weeping weeping-willow.
The river's nine course water
Hears the echoing of telegraph --
And I who sang the original lament
Is now the weeping-willow.
What are vain tears for wine for?
All they do is drag one another
Like a storm in a pond.


A SPRING SONG

Don't leave me behind!
I am a wanderer!
My love, gone are the years!
I wait for you at the green water's end
And me to a stretch of sandy shore
And me to the open river Bui --
Wait till I reach the green-water city
And me and the green river region rainbows
And me a pattern of wildflowers....
I have a thousand songs concerning a bug and a feather.



I who sang the original lament
Has forgotten the guitar the universal sound
West has blown it away.
I am a paraplegic throwback:
I am a singer in a doghouse.
I am a sages in a vestment fill the temple with songs.
I am a world away from the singing,
I intone the accidental tune.
...Bloom is done that mayopicks the river;
Horse power that tamed lion calls;
Wildfire cut across the sky.
...Grateful, I flung aside my wine
And baked

Hape ancients, turning to knowledge,
Deserted the last vestiges of antiquity.
The high roof of a temple-house was matted with damps
And the only means of washing the floor were broken by weeds
With no wonder then of ancient days so sad
That some of them have been gifted the Holy Ghost.
...Fire-flies are gone now, have passed the third floor,
While vines withered along the grassy slope.
Oh, to keep them alive through cold and heat,
Woody-pods wane in the rainy sun,
Andemic drifts are constantly on our radios.
...Oh, return my love, return my lamp
With a sing-song of our hearts --
All you have to offer old comrade.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas complain of thin mulberry-trees
In the Eighth-month chill at the frontier pass.
Through the gate, through the dagger,
Through the heart, catch the bitterness of this-
Out of the world these cuckoos take their leave.
...Grey bayonets are flimsy now, bitter now,
Andia-trees are slanted inwards,
Like roast pine-leaves in a high lantern.
I commend you equanimously
To face to face combat against this stiff-maned galley.


DWELLING BY A STREAM

I had so long been troubled by official graces
That I am glad to be an exile
And am blowing the horn for a song that says....
...Nothing to write but a sigh
And am sighing through a solitary stream.


A LONG CLIMB

In a sharp gale of wind and rain,
Birds and insects fly up to earth,
And the Nile flows like frost between two states
And the deep snow in Zou --
Who has to be greener than an emperor?
...How much better life is with me,
With nothing to fear from the world any more.


ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

I had always heard of lakes and rivers moving,
But never as high as they have stood.
...Destiny is a water-craft company,
With no one to guide it all the way.


BACK AT BORDER-FORTRESS

Destiny is bound to be a source of anxiety
Among the disordered, disconcerted.
...The market-place is now up against the river,
Which means that houses will be ajar if there are no one with him.
...Decay is rising among the sheep and the thecm mare,
And weeds are creeping over old bricks.


A FAREWELL TO WEI WAN

This very country of ours is away from us,
And we allot the old ground for a road-side.
...redarpets can reach the sand,
And a tree-line is cut through the wilderness.
But here at home I must put out a lantern.


A MESSAGE

I am The Master's follower.
Through the heavy gate I have made my house
Relaxed and full of knowledge
I bring to you an invention known as a Teleporter.
The point at which an arrow is aimed
And the pulse of a bugle
Are three points along the river.
And I tell you how to write an ingenious note,
Writing: "I am the master at telling the tales,
Of horses and men.
...In the ancient tales of China rulers drew horses
And use to be known the proficient phoenix.
In these we have a country spirit,
With fur coats and no hair;
And indeed, since to write a writing has its day
And to draw the ever-growing ink-trees,
Why should I cast no vote on this recording?


A CLIMB ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

I. MESSAGE TO CREDIT

The moon goes down behind Yan River,
And the sand is pure with the cold of dawn.
By my regular rain I am washing my feet
In a depth of spring that is both bliss and sorrow.
...Whichever way I clean my teeth, I shall be washing
And never rustling a lake again.


ON NEW YEAR'S EVE

Furling my wings in the nine Firths
I sail for the front, for the star-climbs are open.
My husband, contented and contented,
Is always at the road-side selling melons,
And planting red leaves in the shady noon.

And Wolfee is far behind.

Do you remember an old lady,
With white hair and no brow,
With a face like a snowman,
Her rosy hair brushed by a swift wind;
Her jade hair brightened with the moonlight
And still she was finishing her tea
When her master, a pupil of your,
Was banished for his high position.



SETTING SAO

Is the moon goddess of tranquil seas and quiet skies
With open grasses and pines, her four eyes welling with water
And open with Chinese and Tartar wine?
That is why somebody must be washing the water.
...Winds of spring drive wild beasts wilder
And bury old horses on the muddy shore.


THE MOON AT THE FORTIFIED PASS

The bright moon lifts from the Mountain of Heaven
In an endless blue sky, with the land of the sea
Sinking back again to earth, she has steamed the Pass for three days in one swarm!
This State of the Garden overtops a Southern Country
That is, it runs on the river for three miles.
When the farmers journeyed it back again,
The Lake to the North Star
Birds flock again to their rosy runs;
The Call of the Tartar Mountain shrinks place after call;
The Hollow Mountain cuts across a bleak landscape
As though the cold spray on the river
Were raining stones.


TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. Looking at the moon, I express my thoughts in this poem, which I send to my eldest brother at Fuliang, my seventh brother at Yuqian, My fifteen brother at Wujiang and my younger brothers and sisters at Fuli and Qin.

My heritage lost through disorder and famine,
My brothers and sisters flung eastward and westward,
My fields and gardens wrecked by the war,
My own flesh and blood become scum of the street,
I moan to my shadow like a lone-wandering wildgoose,
I am the target of a jealous eye.



THE JADE DRACER

My jade dagger is the sharpest bow I have ever wielded.
It has the power of cutting brother's men sweat.
When I am fluted across the square, singing the Jade Song,
The iron spear-string cuts the blood-flow.
And the brave who have lost their lives in the Spire of Chaos
Are left with nothing but a thousand rills.


LOST I COME

Much has happened in the palace-gate since I came here.
The Red Phoenix chieftain's horse is dead --
And the Yellow Wolf's pelt is dust.
I CLIMB TO THE LEYOU TOMBS
BEFORE LEAVING FOR WUXING

Because of your service in the war-torn Empire,
I have come back from the desert seeking refuge.
In my western robe I carry a lantern by the hot spring,
Flower-shadows fly up like wings from a dawn,
A thousand butterflies heave themselves to a long song.
They have set fire to chapels and mountain mansions
And rivers and mountains are filled with the Song of Cold Rivers.
...After a night of elation I kiss my jade ring and ride to my rendezvous,
Of breezes in the leaves of a pond beyond return,
Of the ferry-boat moving westward toward Senga.


AEST

The sun has set in the lake and the sand is thick with bamboos.
My lodgings are on the western bank of the high river.
Over the brook and the brook water are aquatic races --
And to my lone watcher the white sand lies open.
...Tavern-ranges, over the mountain, forever narrow....
Mermen horses are curving left and right,
With the upholstered stonework of a temple.
I SEE AN INN

Out on the plain over the clear moon,
Under cloud-tops a thousand heads are drifting.
...I thirst for water's sake everywhere and nowhere thought to drink.
I am born again in the dust of earth.
...Qin City, far beyond Qin,
Is the cradle of a noble and a great ruler.
His clothes have been drowned in the blood of the premier....
The fashion has grown for a king with two tresses.
Be wary of the sand-banks, for they will freeze your horses in wicker baskets.

You can always find your prince.
You were once the best at your country's natural

And likewise a Taoist priest from Loyang came along the river.
And as he went he came upon the person of the celestial
Oraner he looked, as though he were in the street-corner.
And he came to me in a deep mist, asking me where I was going and asking me where I was going.
...I told him I was teaching diwu, the art of traversing the firmament.
He said: 'I am a priest of the firmament,
And I ordain you to follow me'
As the firmament moves, I ordain you to follow me.
...Let never a jade-white recluse tower over your head
Might lead you to wrong trails, beyond which, beyond the wisdom of men,
You will encamp, under blue mountains, for miles and miles,
Till the firmament divides into three sections;
Then, speaking one tune, Shantide, Changhen, and Bing,
Each of them a priest by moonlight,
With wicker-hangers on their heads they can weave in and out.
...If a white-haired monk from Loyang
Dismounts at Loyang and Changsha
By ferry from Loyang, I had brought with me various wines
And song to use when I left the Eastern Woods.
Moonlight was the only light at Loyang,
And across green valleys was to be remembering Lu
And the Eternal City.
...Round the green-plumed gateway at Loyang
There were tall grasses when I entered,
And wide, dark mask-tails when I stopped at a shrine.
...And greater people than ever welcome
And are sincere when they are asked what they are doing.
...Confronted from the pole of the south Star
With red leaves littering the water,
Cicadas, flying home, cry out in a boat;
The Golden Gate opens into two mountain-ranges.
...With China its mountain-site, Sanctuary of the Sacred Heart
Now is an opportunity for those in power.
They can visit me, they can offer me wine.
Still at the mountain-site I cup my lute and dute,
Washing my hands and listening intently.
...The course of the spring willid tiger
Will follow my recite, my sigh free
I feel as though I am floating in the air.
...Near the finish I put away my wine;
I look round and see the palaces of Wu and Han all smooth.
Lotus-tea vases are handed out, announces ten thousand pages.
And Phi Gamma, the official title is peopled.
Be careful out of the world, around the corner.
For life to be fickle and unreliable,
As with wheat and barley, as fate has drawn
You to me so fugly that you weep in your lone pyramid.
...I stroke my white hair. It has grown too thin
To hold the hairpins any more.


ON A RAINY NIGHT
 IN THE MORNING START

Cicadas are hard times for the world
For we near the northern river town, have left it hanging.
...Night has come, with the highs and the drums too late.
I lean by a tree and rest myself
Or write a poem.
Vainly my rag have been words of exchange.
...Rate the mountain melodrama."
The stars and the River of Heaven come alive into the night,
As I had wished when the river had entered earth.
There are no more cicadas by the road-side
And the road has become a slaughterhouse.
Most of my outer space-dwellers
Are now scattered to and fro in the wind.
...Though I have amoured all that lie vacant
For ever and ever between the stars the moon,
I am feeling the chill of dawn.


A CICADA

I am lying in a cicada for the first time.
The ground where I stand is wet with my tears.
I want only a breathing space for my unworthy self-
Yet continuum thought-forms enter and leave me
Like a rushing cloud over a flooded field.



TO A FAMILY PE
And your daughter is now a girl of the river
And all that she has achieved in the world,
You inform me she is only a girl of the Yangzi.
...I long for her to be as rainbow-like
As the Celestial Pedestal was painted on her paints three
Later, when she reaches her full potential,
On a central peak in the Capital of her Precious Color.

May she remain at the Green Water Lodge forever.


RETURNING AT NIGHT TO A PAVILION AREA

Where are you going, Flying Saucers?
Tonight is going wrong for my right foot --
And I hear voices in the clouds of evening.
I watch a low moon lamp after dark;
I feel a chill come over my thin coat.
...I have come too far to look back.


A NIGHT-VIGIL IN THE LEFT COURT OF THE PALACE

Flowers are shadowed, the palace rumbles,
The palace-girls' naked wicker basket weighs on my heart.
...The stars and the River of Heaven begin to fade,
And morning maids from Nineveh sing, over the temple,
As the Koreans do their mountain-clock runs past ten o'clock.
...The palace-girls' naked wicker basket is no help to a maid
Dareful at the dust in the palace-village
Must feel the strain of morning each morning;
And she fails often to give her name.


IN MY LODGE IN NANJING

The morning stars are blowing in the world,
And I hear a tuning-boat rustling in the autumn waters.
...The golden-trees of my mountain-town
Are ever tall enough to welcome a guest,
Yet thin enough to stir the divided river-lands!
...What are the lives of men worth remembering,
Of monkeys and reptiles we lost, yet so beautiful
That they faded into nothingness into the far sky?
...I remember a wind of the autumn mountains that sounded no sound at all,
And the pale sun was faring Nanjing in a thousand valleys.



A MESSAGE FROM LAKE DONGTIN
TO PREMIER ZHANG

The Emperor has commanded that my body sink to the bottom
IN NOV. II

The three-story Imperial Palace opens on a carpet of flowers.
I.-I.-nature am cold in the bud,
And the full moon comes rolling in the moonlight.
I -I.don- THINKING OF HAZHOU

This Wu-town outcrop beneath Phuet Star is my garden,
And the bosom of my beloved must be blurred....
Would not nature love a roused mind to move gardens,
Where by her beauty she ornamented the walls with her favours?
...Of spring blood outshine red leaves,
Spring-heart butterflies are smiling on their lone parrot!
...What are evenmasks, other than those of the Wu- Empire?
....Within this central palace of the Capital,
Princesses all converge on the painted cross.
The red of plant and animal flesh lies on either side the heater;
Drifting in deep thought, I shade my Window-Heroes
And unfold to you the painted rug;
But why should I be envious of the peace-hearted
Of Lady Dengar and her Court of Peppergrass?



HARMONIZING A POEM BY PALACE-ATTENDANT GUO

High beyond the pines the high palace of the foremost official
Is a palace of tears, with its columns of flowers.
View deep blue the River of Heaven, River of Heaven streaming in space,
Autumn-waves rushing in all four directions.
While I meditated, an oriole plum comes flying.
On the purple of the spring, out of the blue,
Thought entered my being of going home.
My adviser, the wise and able Grand General,
Was the first to realize that feelings are born of circumstance.
He expressed no thought to the matter of one another,
So that even the honoured guest, thinking him lowly,
Chose not to ask him any more,'
His feelings for me so indescribable
That even the Emperor was silent.



POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

Forlorn in the northeast among wind and dust,
Drifting in deep thought over ancient rituals,
We survey the two worlds: the bright sun and the dim of sea.
We behold ancient rulers moving, late in the night,
Many a scholar and artist in rich robes.
...Cui Hao, our host, has passed the third week;
And we hushedfully ask his guest where he was born.
"Grandma," he says, "Grandma, have you not heard?"



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME AT A
======================================== SAMPLE 164 ========================================
Yet he thought of fame:
How much better off the earth he might be!
Yet he chose to be a great man, to be a great man.
...And when he reached the top, he found that his chosen few were all scorned.
They all were wrongfully imprisoned --
Who, with the throne still at their feet, was able to decide?
Some of them had only swords to their chests;
The rest were made of clay and wood,
And each boy was born with a yoke:
But what if every child was born toors and anors-fighters?
...He took these scissors and used them, and by the seventh day of his fame,
He made his fellows hail him as hero.
Though they called him a hero, his fame was only a legend.
Scenes of Confucius and Morzi all round him
Were as bleak as the Xie River --
If not lethal, they blasted the sun and moon
With iron shavings that clung to his stare.
Though sharp as swords, their blows were only pencil-trees.
And few people were as swift as he.
So he crossed the Pass between City and Palace,
Green over the head with mountains and rivers,
And guarded the Pass in the snow by unicorns.
And east of the Alps there were flying foxes --
And west of the Jade the Jade City was a Giant.
...Who knew? --
Who prayed? Who encouraged him?
Who encouraged him even after his death?
Whatever happened, he was hero-like;
Hero-like in heart, not lazy or grief-stricken.
Still gone are the days of the old days;
Still alive are the pennies we had long ago 'dropped.'
On the pale purple marsh, alone in its lane of yellow grass,
The playing-men of high honour were passing,
And the statesmen of China and South east Asia were raising their eyebrows.
...At the height of the phoenixes and the lionxes, south of the river,
And of the Bashkots leading a very merry fire,
The magistrate bringing the case was rewarded with a robe of silk.
Still below, gathering dust from the feasts, thoughts of home are spent.
We bid each other a sad farewell, a moment's silence.
We wish we could wave our hands and wave them home,
But we cannot do it. We have to leave you.
...There are sobskines rolling down the river,
That we hear them at dawn stirring the home-basin.
...Our one hope deadened by disorder
Now that happy memories are taken for naught.
And yet we dream of the mountains that they will be almost gone in ten days,
And of the cliffs that they will be eight thousand miles without a cross....
Night in the temples is over-the-hill rain,
Dust has settled over the white sand,
No more birds craved for in the old Gorgonzon --
There is nothing left but white sand and craven officials
Serving in a distant land.
We Apaches number Bytemuschis in long rows,
Because of our petals seeking the King's peace.
We White Martyrs in the Westgate Ropes Weeps that nothing lasts as long
But the whim of the world's multitude.
...How much better off the better off we are,
We White Palaces can boast of our Feathered Chair!
...In the Chamber of Rank and file we drink to our fellow soldiers
Thoughts of duty do little to calm us.
Though we have been chosen for this purpose, we still think of death --
In our own homes, though we are great and noble,
We watch a sad-eyed Taoiseach down the inner mountain
While dark clouds are threads parting the River of Stars.
 - -From the vain thoughts of the long-agoedition
That we have been chosen like them, here by the long-agoedition,
We have been selected for this purpose, we still think of death.
Though we have been chosen for this purpose, we still think of death.
Though we have not been chosen for this purpose, yet we are still honoured as we were.
...Do you imperial commissioners
Mean to be a part of all this? - in the end,
You are as noble in heart and as hot-blooded as a cow-herd.



THE INLAID HAPPINESS

A journey through the mist
comes with its hazards.
The high road is shrouded in fog
And the water soars over rugged hills.
...While women manner each other sweetly,
And men cannot help laughing,
Do travellers often mix wine and rolls of jade?
There are stranger clouds and familiar watery mountains
And harder
======================================== SAMPLE 165 ========================================
The day is near, and I ask you where I have been.
...I have been missing for three nights.
I leave my post at Maosuca.
I am sick in the palace-village.
I come home to my messengers from the sea.


SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

The white cycle of the year
Escortates into the passageway
Of spring he comes, blurred with sunset.
...The ancient language has worn thin;
Trees echo with monkeys on the banks of Lake Dongting.
The fisherman hears bell-notes in the evening rain;
And Mother Nature sends twigs flying with a wind of distant flowers
Within ere long she lives.


A FAREWELL TO WEI WAN

The travellers-at-large doing official duty
Oh, let them consult the guide who has come to them
And assign duties such as of this nature
That they may office-bonfire together,
And celebrate together the Mountain of Heaven!
...The Yang Temple towers, before the River of Stars,
And the incense-pillars smoke and a shower.
Let your missions take them home
With a feeler of victory on their cheek.


A MESSAGE TO HAN CHO THE YANGZHOU MAGISTRATE

Here in the highest palace the High Moon comes hovering over the palace
And a thunderbolt crackles like snow
Wherehaft all the while on the constant threat of a frost-
political constellation.
Let haste be followed by beauty!Let haste be followed by beauty! --
The blue sky is broken and the water is sweet
With the cry of a wildgoose in the brook.


A CONFESSION

With my wine-bottle, watching by a screen of tears,
Confessions of a long-serving premier
All but one of his closest friends:
"That cheek was well-blendered, not by our Western Ministers,
But by a Song of Courtyard Flowers.
And he buried it where a festival takes its pomp --
In the Three Sails ceremony, in the Signature Pool.
But since the South China sea moves often enough,
And homesick memories haunt me to the finish,
I do what needs be done.


A PARTING

With no other husband but my heart,
I sit and weep and weep till the stars separate us.
And then the game is taken away from me
And my round, round body is brought to the Realm of the South Sun.
Where is my shining head?....
Up from the Temple of the White God on King Uri into the Clouds,
The Lords of the Realm of the South Sun have come all the way
To Chu Island to see us in peace.
Summon me like a wildgoose, like a dove lost in the whirlwind.
Preparing me wildgeese-cups, preparing me pears-of-horn.
You wish I could summon the spirits of dragons and of kings!
Why not me, my flaming-haired petal-bough?



SHE SINGS AN OLD CYPTIC

Ling lived maneca, the great creator of the three worlds
And a great, odorous cloud, full of evil thoughts!
Eunuchs from Youzhou were courtiers before the Sun,
And his countless models of silk inspired the three classes of ladies
Who competed for office first in the Five Dynasties.
The Emperor's horses were first in the Court of the King of Wei;
Then the dynasties of Jiang, Ling, and Wu all began looking at him
And Eastern resplendent in fame followed Westerners;
The costumes, the music, the epoch-making music
Were bringing glory to a Dynasty that was abolished
And epoch-making to a Dynasty that was rapid and bloody.
...Han of the Crown brought his massive flags of victory
To the imperial bride in a gala show;
The bride was chosen by the Emperor as her own and knotted in twos
And she was favoured by a close circle of friends,
All of whom were brought to you by one heart.
You have your cake here, I have mine. Go and eat!



THINKING OF A FRIEND LOST
IN THE TIBETAN WAR

Last year you went with your troops to Tibet;
And when your men had vanished beyond the citywall,
News was cut off between the two worlds
As between the living and the dead.
No one has come upon a high building before the rain.
And the generals of the time were scrupulously observant
Of ancient wars, moderns are dust.
Go back now and watch the battles on the horizon
While farmers and factory-hands await the army's departure.



======================================== SAMPLE 166 ========================================
The neighborhood of the Forbidden City is littered with body parts of long-necked men,
All of them Chinese-Canine.
With a sound of swindling a drum hangs,
In a slow drum comes the grieving Mother of Heaven.
The lonely note of a long-necked Hou
Goes smoothly down a chair in the quiet evening.
...Not for a moment do I fear for my loved one.
Though a thought leaps to my breast,
It is enough for this I beg you.
...We both are Zhuangzi reunites,
We met three years ago in prison;
We both are Saints.
Why should I frighten the Coward
How gladly I plough in the night
And loosen my guard at the Adrian Bridge?
...At the same time as we wait for the courier,
On the Yangzi shore a low sound of a door-bell.
On a northern road with gravely flowers
You have left me nothing to chance with your art,
Yet I careened among weeping flowers toward your lonely house.
...For years I have been Amos' helper,
Till late at night I sit and watch a lost cat,
And a lost midnight salmon running along the river.
...Grey clouds have waken the Cities of Yan and Du --
And the pot of blood I have been holding is only water now....
The city-plant that once was your country's sacred asset
Is being taken by the vengeful spirit.
You traded your life for that of a hopeful spirit.
You regretted not to have known that the Jiangsu mountains
Are stolen by the vengeful crocodile.
...As I wait for the courier to sail, I see a yellow river
Slanting down the river to its precipitous ground.
...Sinking back again will be tenable for the day.


A SONG OF A GUITAR

I was bidding a guest farewell
And announced my long-cherished tweet:
...After quite a while, here is the tweet of a guest
Who, lost in a world of long ago,
Must have seen the long blue sky after the Rainbow Road Bridge collapse.
...The road will move on its own willowing tide,
With no one to help her from beyond the collapsed wall.
On the river between high heaven and low earth, flowers are gathering,
And the fisherman knows he has caught a rare pearl --
Oh, ask the bright-flowing wine of Yan country
Which has made me speechless
And who watches the lonely sky downward.


FROM AN UPPER STORY

Flowers are rising again in the Street of Blue Houses
And the porcelain staircase is green with Damien Wirth!
And the Emperor has ordered that nothing in the Temple ever comes into being.
...Though I value life much, I cannot seem to find out
What it costs to be an empty shell.


I hear, from all four quarters, one dying man
Who, riding a high lute, sings a foreign tune.
...High beyond the southern mountains lies a low and desolate world;
And the moon goes down behind a ruined fort,
And the wind flees between two barbarian fortresses.
Birds flock and sing when the barbarian river burns;
Petals be fallow from space from the Siberian mountains
And rain comes thin that marks the shore.
Where are those golden lids badgeing us?
And where is the silver lids badgeing us?


IAWYING AT A TEMPLE OF LIGHT
ON THE TERRACE OF GENERAL WU

The flag of loyally flashing east
Has not illumined anIflower, a Temple- Flower with her blossoms;
War-torches and tempestuous mountainsife threads thread;
Her odours of sweet wine drown out;
Her incense-spices drown out;
Her holy incense drowns the music;
But still life shines through the day,
With its sweet beat of a mirror.


TURKESTAN

On a northern mountain a lantern is employed
To dimly flicker over a misty ocean
And night-knife herats a frog-man cave-in.
...The wide path, the blue moon, is slowly turning
Green against frost-pen. The water is sweet with our drink;
The blue water of mountain-trees everywhere a mingling of birds.
Her camels were still warmer than we,
When the mountain-spirit settled at the western capitol.
...Wildgeese are land-spirit now-no longer with us,
And Albanians, forever lost, forever longing,
Here in her creeping heart, sob along, waiting.


A SONG OF A GIRL

News
Freedom for all
Began on a cold spring night
And waned in the waves of the sea,
When Ateneos, my single rival, with my hundred coins,
Birthed two thousand wives by the heat of battle.
...Who can say? for I have won, by a dart,
The tributes of a temple-state on the blood of warriors.



A KIND THING IN HER BORDER-BREATH

Gazing Across the Sun-City Night-Moon
Flies Asleep in the Tower to the Stars Above Heaven,
She sees Beyondness for whom she lights a candle,
And where the stars Go, Where shall we meet?


A PARTING

Friend, I am parting with wine
As I always am;
But first I need laugh;
Then again I think of new friends;
And I wonder what to do left me
Once so happy!


AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

When the ferry-boat moves by a river,
Sweetly autumn air blows on its sails;
The fine crows that areexternalActionCode still
Are here before the general who commanded the expedition
And autumn is bound to winter-tide months,
And winter-shine is creeping across the empty mountains --
And I who came a long way have been forgotten.


NIGHT IN THE WATCH-TOWER

While winter daylight shortens at its center
And snowmobilting over the mountain,
Stark sounds the first dawn on the barbarian,
There is no knowing unless with what
That the first rain- comes to the barbarian.


NIGHT IN THE WATCH-STATION

While the element of weather lightens
And deep snows run amok under the mountain,
There is not one cloud left between valleys and hills,
There is only a sand-man in the blanket of dusk.


SPRING HEART-BREAK

With twilight cuts across the Pearl-Sliver,
There is no knowing dawn but darkness in the watch.
...The war has ended, the world has left us;
And we can see the white clouds that will follow;
They will be floating along the Wuyi border
Where spring is headed south in the west.


A NIGHT-MOORING NEAR MAPLE BRIDGE

While I watch the moon go down, her rhythmic note
Lengthy a blur of light grows too slow,
And the distant stars that peeked through the fog,
Tops my solitary lantern and into a dark room.


SPRING HEART-BREAK

When a thread in a moth's darkness is as yet invisible
And a moth alone consumes the food of the rainbow,
Yet through all this I have lost what I love
And what is left me now of home and of love.


IN A ANGLE WITH THE BUDDHIST PILGRIM

The three-story building block of a holy palace
Is open to the first dawn of a shower.
Then, taking off his hood, he grins. -"I pray that it may be of use to me,
That I may step into the Christ crucible and be present
And be present with the moon and the wheatplant,
As I stand here and watch the rain on Palm Saturday.


AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

During the day I watch a bough of wheat grow
And at night I watch a halogen lantern come
Sunny in the wind.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME FROM A NIGHT-RIVER

Last night the river joined the mountains --
A fisherman for the first time has come down
And is seeing the eye of the whole empire.


ON NEW YEAR'S EVE

Farther and farther down the river from the capital,
I have come three thousand miles, anxious and watchful,
Through pale green dragon-packs and pale with sunrise;
Down set ablaze temples, to be found
The ritualistic initiation ceremony for the new moon and stars.


A REPACKAGING

With hunting-fires bristle high at the northern border,
And icy Russops grace the mountainside with autumn dawn,
I have taken my peace from the world into my own time.
So packed are my walls and walls of the south
That even the King of Hesse can zone them from my conquering,
So green the rivers and the rivers of the southwest
That even the cheek of a wildgoose is safe in Ithaca.


ON A NEAR-GOING

Thoughtful steps are like a thousand strings;
But Tripod locates his horses in pairs

THE JADE DRESSING-TABLE

Last night my girdle came undone,
And this morning a luck-beetle flew into my
Merry room.
What luck was found, I wonder?
The maiden wept, for she had been secretly ill.


AT JING CHEIFF CHE

The hall-groom of the Emperor is setting music,
And, mingling with himself, he offers a cup of wine
To Lady Choupo, the new favourite,
Butlers, and dancers all deck his table.
...Down in the water of winter it never rains,
So hetails from Jia Mountain a boat that has come from Cheng
First to the palace, then to the shops.
And as he hibes through songs worth hearing,
He comes to understand that nothing is sacred but snow and stars.


A FAREWELL TO HAN CHO

There are sobs when death is the cause of parting;
Yet life has its partings again and again.
So ask gods on earth
For a wanderer so far away
To find the bandage he so craves.


A BRIEF BUT HAPPY MEETING WITH MY BROTHER-IN LAW
"MEETING BY ACCIDENT, ONLY TO PART"

After these ten torn wearisome years
We have met again. We were both so changed
That hearing first your surname, I thought you a stranger --
Then hearing your given name, I remembered your young face....
All that has happened with the tides
We have told and told till the evening bell....
Tomorrow you journey to Youzhou,
Leaving autumn between us, peak after peak.



A FAREWELL TO HAN CHO

When heaven and earth began circling Youzhou,
Each side of the mezzanine ages ago,
War-fires shake the meadows and mountains,
And the wind has nothing to do with cloud but white dust....
Meeting, though we are different,
We harbour a great hope of merging,
That with our two wheels we can control our own destiny.



WHEN LU LUN MY COUSIN COMES FOR THE NIGHT

With no other neighbour but the quiet night,
Here I live in the same old cottage;
And as raindrops brighten yellow leaves,
The lamp illumines my white chair.
The wide lane leads to the mountain temple --
And I unburdYAN HAPPILY
THE MOUNTAIN LU

Here I live, in a little straw hut,
With my twilight sheets and I88 drops.
The low moon is deepening its channel
And the clear stream passes through our little hut.
...With LU LUN MY COUSIN DEAD
AT FOUR HEADY CROADS

In the open sky LU LUN MY FRIENDS DEAD

Lately we have been needing each other as friends --
That deeper and farther we move,
As LU LUN MY FRIENDS AT THE FOUR HEADY CROADS

...to our three stars, sunset and dawn.
To and fro at will we sling our hands to the fluttering ground
And leap, forgetting our nets, without stopping.
...At ease in our lone sail, with no sails around the sand,
We brush our weapons in the perspective of a river of flowers.
And at ease in our lone sail, with no weapons around the water,
We just plough and bury our weapons-of peach and plum-in the shadowy river.
...With LU LUN MY FRIENDS DEAD
AT FOUR HEADY CROADS

Last night a lonely river-merchant drowned in her mist
And in the river an army surveillance plane floats.
...With LU LUN MY FRIENDS
AT FOUR HEADY CROADS

One night a lonely wild-goose, lost in a haze of mist,
Leaves the bank at low moon and stars.
Comes the sound of a fisher-boat mingling with the water.
...Between us near scarlet clouds are shoulder to shoulder --
And our watches close at night, near and far,
And our taxes early broke ten per cent.,
And we think's we both dead, like yellow buds lost in a rain of sores....
But this is life after death,
That you can always find your way back.

Egyptian fishermen lying in the tributaries of the Red River,
Who had spent the night dreaming of sea,
Could finally awake their souls in the clouds.
They could feel the swift waves moving...
And, with restful eyes, at the height of summer
They could see the Magician at work.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

"Honor be to meet you at the Magician's Sanctum --
A man less fortunate than you,
Who still can summon the breath of youth.
...We parted, then, over the Chosin Desert,
Away from the clutches of fortune and from official duty
And we met, at the Dancing Star of Heaven,
At a temple called The Power of Ch'u-t'ang.
And we raised our cups and wished each other a happy ending --
And then, holding them in our hands,
We met, on the other side, at a gay dance
Toward our new-found fame.
...The Magician had vanished in the mist;
The Chosin Dial tone heard echoing away.
There were clear green locust-trees on either side of the priest
And low branches of foreign shrubbery in the silent distance.
But who of us listened to a Ch'ang song?
We knew too well enough about ancient gods and about the power of a god,
So we played the guitar to our friend ChenGGanI
For the ancient chieftains of the Pacific were like us --
The warriors we parted with cowered under the yoke,
And the drifts which gnawed our guitars feathered our faces.
...Our guitar-players, us aicigmatos,
Dancing still, our moment's fame had expired.
We were musicians in the time of a king, playing for court officials
And noblemen of old days and ages were venerating our guitars.
We feasted, wine was drunk, and duked it out with the crowd.
We turned the playing-panetticoats to our own music,
We sang, we kicked drums, we shuffled our boxes,
We drew our weapons and marched our horses.
But since the State is formed of a wide range of races,
With Asian seafaring statesmen as warriors,
We call on one comrade, deficient in spirit,
To guide our nobleman on his western adventure.
...We wish one day to command the Chinese of the river;
We look on his embroidered silk combs
And see his youthful face covered with bitter tears.
Though troubled and sleepless he has still found his passion
And will soon reach northern China.
Though lost in a world where love is the central tenet,
There is stillness in the river's calm waters --
And wept when we finished!


A SONG OF A VETERAN BUDDHIST HERMITAGE

Into the final moments of a hermitage
Covered by moss and tree-gum, high only on the birds' hoofs,
Theist and disbeliever, together climbing the ladder
Will find the highest place, the final solitude.
...The hermitage has been maintained
By early autumn rain, by the careful care of the seasons.
The stars and the River of Heaven slowly darken,
And the dew from candles on the mountain
Breaks every fibre of my being.
I dream of a freer world than that of the hermitage,
With its own flora and fauna and its own judgment
Doubtless there are even herewho mistake beauty for knowledge.
...I awake, as though I were dreaming, of the mountain at dawn;
And, alas, is it that I check to see if it is well?
 dawn
Or dusk?
Or dawn?
I try to read the hermitage's cryptic note,
My lamp falls and I see only fog and sand.
And so I put away my horse and bow and wandered alone.
At twilight I trill the word of a wise and happy sage,
Whose message I vainly searched for the past midnight.
I echo Yama's plea to beware of long delays,
Newts cheer me on my mountain advance
And bounds my car from town to town.
I barreled eastward, into a valley full of flies --
That soul stayed at the fork of the mountain,
That grey river-murchotted my vine.
...At first I am glad to swallow my dose of tepidness
While my lane is thronged with travellers' invites...
And at dusk I emerge from my hermitage's west chamber,
With my vine-silk green and my cloudy sword slung over my face.
...And at dusk I harness my sail and ride it to the mountains

======================================== SAMPLE 170 ========================================
Many of us, in poor countries where peace is sought,
See only despair and the cutting of swords.

The ruined Tower of David shadowed long ago.


A SONG OF SOBBING BY THE RIVER

I am only an old woodsman walking on moonlight.
...Turning at the foot of high grasses and parting soon-to-come trees-plant-willows,
I can see trees colouring a distant hill.
A lone cloud hangs a few pines away,
And distant swallows call among them.
...Let pure water go homeward over the river
And no one disturb your music --
A sob carries the tune home.


A LONG CLIMB

In a sharp gale from the wide sky apes are whimpering,
As men of old days rush by, fresh with fallow grasses,
And women in icy hues reading The Fire God's Supper.
Free of home, poor as we are,
And deprived of our sheep-feather elk,
Why should you thread a fine river,
Go riding-with tears into the frost-white grasses?
...There are stranger animals in your sail,
More like sheep than horses: lean but not yet fourteen,
Too small to hold our own against the strong waves.
...To kill a cat-troll is a long road,
But two manoe birds can cut the path to glory.
...How can I bear toiling in the pit of earth
Even the light of my lamp?


A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

From the iron dagger that held the world in my hand,
I drew my finish into a purse of marbles.
Blue flies and golden lakes fly and swirl on the river
And a sudden sound of an opening sob in the drowned water.
...Before I knew it, the note was dropping,
It was an Election Day. And the General Forge, far away,
Where I watched the Emperor standing before the House of Han,
My turn was called. He took my ballot, and I gave my name only as Zagros.
Both of us seniors here shake our hands. We both are changed, then dead.
...Golden-worms are died of hunger, though we affirm our virginity.
So bold are our souls, so quick they can hold a candle to the Sun,
That wept upon our hands and our knees for days.



A WEAPON OF I, II, III, IV

Weap on our spear-wields the autumn grass and branches,
And our loads, our valuables, are now scattered like the rain --
A carpet of cinnamon-green grass and boughs, a poem on the sand.
...Let no one challenge me to a battle,
No one challenge me to a ruin.
My dagger is clean, my sword is never missed.
My fellow soldiers, we weep together, we cannot separate.
We have been fighting here ten years;
And the Emperor sends us away again as a sign of recommitment.
We await. Then enter.
The dagger is in our palms.
We await.


A SONG OF A POOR GIRL

cardinal de Lima
passionsately brushes her dagger with his thumb.
The cold wind blows softly under her brow,
The wet breath fades through through her nostrils,
The lamp is on her straw-hearth, but not blinding her
She studies the ode to the forest, not the harp;
The autumn sunset shines on three hills:
Her heart is in her guitar, her eyes on the song.
When the guitar fails, listen to her song:

I go in the dusk, looking for you.
There, beside a large root,
Are autumn flowers and grasses,
And the ferry-boat moves silently.
...After enough, I turn and see the moon descending
One by one....
With slow motion flash colours of coloured stones;
Then, slowly ascending, slow motion,
They shift course one by one as though they were flying;
And, first a Turcanist boat approaches, then a Europeans
Sharing a glance, then a Linguist boat approaches.
...I am travelling with you, with your books and lectures;
And if ever you are called a wild-goose,
I will guide them like a spear.

======================================== SAMPLE 171 ========================================
See how hemp, the neighbour's money-waster, has been sown among us:
Hemp, as a tree, warms the heart of man,
And will surely reach heaven within a day.
But since hemp-blood is calmed by its Creator,
Who encouraged it to percolate through the ages,
We cultivate it for its sweetness and its strength,
Whose sake is its reward, and ours a curse?
If it lasts, if it survives, then are we still left with children
Just waiting for the right colour to visit their fathers!



THINKING OF an aged BROTHER

There lived, after life's bounty,
On one man's desert island a bird that sounded the trumpet.
And then came the famous poem,
How right and right mother had been
Without waiting for her son to be grown.
The more he watched the more he loathed his mother --
Who was so pure and innocent that even the Devil despised
Those she love were pitiable even after love has died.
...Who knew that even the Light of Heaven could be as harsh
As this one who was so pure and innocent?



ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where loveliness has sent its white clouds,
Who knows how many ghosts are bound up
In one place where the seasons have ceased?
...There were beauties and wonders of the world,
Yet at the Golden Pool tables of flimsy chairs
Are filled with nothingness and with too much wine?



THE GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

- Whata, since I catch you fishing,
Why yes, on the banks of the river
You table therepasseskings and willows therealongs,
And the coast of Nanjing thereboysquats
Topsail-dwelling all night in the wave
And comes the cool of dawn,
Who knows what he is doing at home?



ON THE GATE-WHISPEETT ON THE JIANDE RIVER

Where grey waters are stirling the banks of the river,
And yellow vines are blowing down a white house,
There are seven kings and their horses on a row,
And a fisher-boat is drifting along
On a streak of sunset over the river.
...Who knew that through the magic of the floating sky
And the Princess' dancing, human hearts could love
?

It is not so very far to Swan River if ILimit.

A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

breathing new life into the old drums,
Breathing new life into the old drums,

Whose souls I audio today as of writing.
Song has not yet ended, as it began its dance.
Emperor Palaces are cleared of snow, mountains dry,
And rivers all round empty.
...Clover-men are turning south, not north of the bank.
I am here, receiving news, not from palace doors,
But from Emperors themselves, pouring over trash.
...I have taken my ease here long enough.
What am I waiting for, I wonder.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME
ON THE CHU RIVER

A cold wind blows from the river's banks.
People are passing the town of Huai,
And fishermen are anchoring on the border of Wei and Han.
The night will come that no one cares
Anything more about Wu than her beauty right now.
...Who knows but me about the world,
I am old and drunk and never coming back?


ON THE BORDER

Thoughtful eyes gaze down on the mountain
Which says good-bye, but not knowing how to send it,
How to sew the clothes over my body;
There are clothes all the way to heaven,
Yet I care not what country it is from which I shall be sent.
...The border town is night- crossing --
And the mountains and the river all are gone.
...Where are you going, friend? Gone forever?
...I am running to a new start
With no news from home or with my old friend.
...When shall I be hearing from you again?

The familiar song, the familiar tune,
Everywhere in between these familiar words
Are telling us something different....
Time goes on, never ending,
As we watch the bright moon set over a wild goose.



ON NEW YEAR'S EVE

Farther and farther from the three Ba Roads,
I have come three thousand miles....
Through pale snow-patches in the jagged heart of a mountain man,
I have heard a bell, a tread of snow, a
======================================== SAMPLE 172 ========================================
Round the corner the Imperial Garden is full of flowers;
Flowers of spring flow their magic through the pink oriole cord,
While the Imperial Stone glistens like spring light on my heart.
I am a poor souliling away in my little cottage.
I am a wealthy and happy man in his lategold bed.
We talk about great authors and eminent musicians.
We read, in ruddy chapter and verse, his poems on metal and silk.
...What a flame for his immortal bosoms!
Spin a thousand pieces of silk and three thousand songs,
All of them written in the style of King Lear!
...Let me fling down my first action picture,
Let me harness my two dancers' rapids
Like Saint Ambrose before Saint Winston,
Let me raise my two dancers' purses --
Let me harness my two falcon casings
Like Saint Omei, King of The Clouds,
Like Saint Egidhope, Emperor of Thailand,
Like Lady Terrace-boat-crew, on our way to action!


A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Rise, before dawn, in the MoL
As the strong wind of a spring storm;
A thunderbolt ripples through the plain
And leaves a trail of tender grasses --
But before dawn I'm humming a tune of a tune of a tune of a tune....
The central star has descended. The roofs of many a city-gate are gone;
Cicadas have been stranded along the river's two coves.
...Whose mountains to raise, whose horses to sell,
Cattle to drive, chickens to eat,
Calves to eat their former flock,
Fowl to fly and animals to eat....
I pull out my copy of the Incense-Box and see that name for Wang Tao --
The Forbidden City's Dragon God.
The Forbidden City is full of ghosts and of clouds of midnight.
...I climb to the top. I climb. I breath again.
I watch the red lights of dawn go out --
And I write a poem as action-phyre,
Ashes myself to a mountain-snow-glade,
My head first into the skychamperty for water,
Then turns and sits by a high lantern
And looks out over the sea-gulls
For his boundless appetite.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Rise, before dawn, in the southern stars
As the strong winds of a spring storm;
A mist in the midday sun blows human flesh
To and fro on horseback, into the catacombs.
...In a wooded sanctuary among winding green mountains,
A thousand flowers and drums are ours, each gold leaf gold;
And I, a stranger in this southern city,
Hears a bell tolling my car,
And my companion, the Lesser Li,
Reading from an enchanted screed
All night in a court of the Five Cities
Against the bright moonlight
How to find your lost companion.


BORDER-SONGS

The woods are black and a wild deer hunts with them
And a fisher-boat races along the river.
...If they caught you in a pin-point range,
Could not dart for you on your scooter?
...If you called a wild deer by its herd,
Till your horse wintered in the sand.


A CLIMB ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

Monkeys and birds are abounding
In the bounty of moonlight.
...To and fro in the £50c river
I find your river-villages emptily full of camels and wolves.
And yet how many are there, and how eager are they to gather
And make a profit selling moonlight on their comebacks?
...I lift the hood and see white clouds building
Over the river-town; they are waving their white flags
As ever the Emperor desires.


ON NEW YEAR'S EVE

Finches flash yellow through the fog
Of the Dragon Lake trail and enter Lake Huai.
And a number of the Capital's white cliffs
Hush for a moment. Then do you think I will come?
At midnight I arise, lie down, and recline,
On a high bed in the Bright Peak sunset.
...SWAMP is stirring again,
Lakes are returning to cold wounds.
War-torches invade the empty clouds.
Apes invade the Black Mountain.
Apes invade the Dragon Lake.
...I lift off my cloak, see where the dragons are,
And I wake Minerva McGonagall.
Too late, indeed, but for her temperance languor.
She has turned a blind eye to this sad state.
The new President-at-Large has been summoned.
May
======================================== SAMPLE 173 ========================================
All night long the River of Heaven has been heavy
On the few surviving senses -- taste, touch.
Mists have moved over the richest coins and most precious valuables,
Withches watched from the spectator tower for a lost palanquin.
...Where are the gold and the rare silver? And is it anyone that you know?
I ask you what you ask of Emperor Liu:
His kitchen-pan is full of little herbs --
He has two thousand of timber
On cold spring evenings and cold fires three thousand.
...The first snow to stand on the lake since the War of the Golden Pear,
And the second frost to remain in the North Star from the start of the war,
Since the Southern Motherland, the Motherland of China,
Between the Golden Bridges three thousand miles have I waited.
...The last frost along the Yellow Horse,
The travelling Bingqian,
The Bingqian under the North Star.
Peach-trees die away, rivers and lakes are littered
With brown and deep cypresses --
Yet the famous Bridge of Long Life is high and vigour-
And people who live in peace now follow the River of Gold.
...Look how well Emperor Liu cares for his white horse
And the beautiful girl from Qin who lives here with him.
...In a boat the white as snow, gone am I,
Where willows purify the homes of the Red and Blue Raiders
And, balancing a lute-wencher, sings a song of truce?



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

lying motionless under old leaves for a while,
Is a girl of the Copper Nose speaking to her elder brother,
Who, stooped, looked toward the east,
Wistful for days and nights, but not knowing where he was,
The gale that is slowly chokes the northern river and cripples the southern country,
As the fisherman steams up the Heng Mountain pass.
...The curious coral-head man from Henan, unaware of his great good fortune,
Wistened for days by the sadness of the first day,
But glad this daylight with the daylight it brings him,
The fisherman fishs-and-atches the day, lights his fishing- rod
And soon he has a face of crystal that lets him see anywhere on the water,
Over the waves or below the waves, or any of them.
...For years I have lived in Guoshens, sifting through garbage,
But this old practice of mine losing my fishing- rod,
Dreading the cold, watching the rain,
I climb up to the top and, forgetting what to say,
Ask the old temple-bell.



STAYING AT THE YANGZHOU FERRY

With low self-confidence, great to-day,
I have been affairs of the year in my northern city.
I hail you from Yangzhou lightly.
You are sound enough of mind to know that no more sons and daughters
Are born to brothers and no daughters.
...I came, a few days ago, away from the capital of Yanzhou
To the palace of the King of China. Juniors and high ladies be welcome
And, here by my door, I await the morning bell.


FROM A MOORING ON THE TONGLU
TO A FRIEND IN YANGZHOU

With your capital so far toward the South,
Do you not fear discovery? --
Mists have moved beyond the horizon
And sea-selves are dancing in the wind;
And the river, when you have called from your deck "
Before me a wildgoose in a cuckoo" (The Little Ones, at Emei Palace, at the Conquest of the Wuagui, at the Conquest of the Huai).
...There were other animals, larger and tougher,
In the day when your Pavilion was larger and wider.
And then came the most sacred flower,
And, alone in the palace, a thousand birds and flies.
...


TO A FRIEND BOUND NORTH
AFTER THE REBELLION

In the twilight my spirit has been lost in the Whirlpool of Heaven
And nothing can ameliorate its sorry state.
...The new government has encouraged industry;
The Lords of the Realm have rewarded its Creator with bounties;
And people are returning from all the Great Raises.
But has the throne itself been able to guard it?
Testify before the House of the White God
And ask what it has been through change.


PARTING I

Even in this world the spirit of a hero
Lives and reigns for thousands of years.
You were head of an imperial household. A river sent you:



======================================== SAMPLE 174 ========================================
somewhere through the twilight look upon a hundred islands
With a desolate sea of cloud and a bright sun,
And twilight fishermen playing catch
And twilight farmers riding their boats,
And twilight fishermen riding his boat,
Land of the wildgeese and the river-headers,
With the peaks and rivers pointing west.
...There's a fisherman on one of these islands,
There's a fisher-boy on the other.



A LONG CLIMB

In a sharp gale from the wide sky apes are whimpering,
Birds are flying homeward over the clear lake and white sand,
Leaves are dropping down like the spray of a waterfall,
While I watch the long river always rolling on.
I want to be at a festival.
I am anxious about the weather.
I am looking forward to Hill Giant.
...Oh, let me fling down my very own great
House, magnify my fame!
Why not join the crowd and welcome me?


ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where is the music of the game of pheasants?
The beating of pheasants fills the cold air with wind and rain,
And a low voice in mid-session, calling from a distance,

Would be quiet on the Jiangs if there were no Hall-duppers.
...I would sit and write a song, taking notes as to when I should be returning,
 Returning the favour, I sang it, I blew the mute note,
I sang it so thick and deep that my ink tumbled through the ceiling....
A FAREWELL TO WEI WAN

By your every whim and your every word!
I would cross the Yellow River without waiting for you;
I might trample the rocks that guard the Jade Pass,
I might strangle the still-living,
 I might stove-top and rice-cupholder my guest.
...Oh, if there be anyone left who can help us, it is you!
We whisper to each other over and over again,
That we have the better of the catch, the catch we pay.
...We hardly know one another,
We are two remote nights away,
And the river's nine streams all merge into one....
When shall we者Call you home--
And how? By asking me your last name.



A SNOWy MONUMENT SPRING

In the tall trees that circle the palace,
Night dries on the lake and the mountains....
Renouncing in hushed tones the weather,
I plucked my fisherman's girdle and his dagger,
And weathered by the mist the suddenness of the moon....
At sunrise we cups our teapots,
We listen to the summons from the palacesmaid
And my husband watches from his deck the sunset.
...He seems to be at a fair,
As at a fairchanged mansion.


ON HEARING A FLUTE AT NIGHT
FROM THE WALL OF SHOUXIANG

The sand below the border-mountain lies like snow,
And the moon like frost beyond the city-wall,
And someone somewhere, playing a flute,
Has made the soldiers homesick all night long.
...The ground where they have laid their flags all around the wall
Is shaken with grief and with wist,
As they watch the red banners wane.


ON HEARING AN OLD GENERAL
STATIONING AT A TEMPLE OF YAN

While the autumn night cataracts the sun,
The valleys and the mountains are gleaming with the autumn moon,
Ordinarily at night these things take place,
But this season of the cloudy sky summons me,
When I remember the lilting of a song cowering there,
And the comforting of a sacred song.


STAYING AT THE GENERAL'S HEADQUARTERS

The autumn night is overcast at the valley mouth,
And the sky is purrs with a north wind,
But I still live at the camp of the General,
Known as by his drums the world knows only by his drums;
He is at the head of his men in the snow;
He is advancing on his General Thurman while the cold in the river is blowing;
And so it is that I live at the camp of the General.
...As I weep for my old friend and brace myself for the Horde,
I hear the tragic plea, "Another day, Peggy."


APPEALS TO THE GENERAL AT THE TEMPLE OF GENERAL THOMAS

Sky and rain have fallen down from the South Wind,
While I have gazed again on the White Mountain crest
And the yellow sun has gone berserk.
What are you thinking of,
======================================== SAMPLE 175 ========================================
Against the cold sun of autumn in the bamboo-trees
That cloud three thousand feet and a midly,
The War Department tentatively sends out its secretary.
...If he is chosen, we all take our leave;
There's no one here to handle the messengers;
There are only hoof-heels and a can of wine.


AFTER THE BORDER TRIPLE

West is the City of Silk and the tides are swift;
And still is the hunt for Horse-Powered Terriers.
...Destiny consumes my heart! Where is my horse?
I watch my white beard inches from earth;
And White Wolf Mountain slowly whiteen its seat
And a waterfall rid the white clouds of all rain.


A SPRING SONG

Remember the fisherman from Ye Gao
Who fame has referred him to countless books.
Into the rain of the river,
Through the mist of battle nothing comes of it.
...While my little boat moves on its mooring of duck and fly,
I am singing its lullaby, Oh, the Town of the River God!
The moon is gay with rain,
The woods are green with frost,
And at the ferry we boarder's longing
For home.


A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

From long ago awarded fame for his hard work,
The Emperor gives him a new mermaid finishing dress.
...Don't wash your ears on hearing a pebble
Nor die of hunger like famous hermits on the Pike!
The victory we achieved last night is a supreme event.
The mighty Courage Towpaths wonder at you.
The Emperor gave you this coin for his famous lute.
It cannot be cheated, we swear, by another man's fame
For we have witnessed the life of the Emperor
See how he tries to conceal his bright eyes from the constant touring.
...Earn we old wounds country by country.
Prepare yourself for an evening pillory --
As heavy as a banquet!


A FAREWELL TO WEI WAN

Dare I, at my age, accept my summons,
That I might take my old cassock and set it aside,
For the red flower of my northward journey.
...Walk in the cool of our friendliness,
As I did last night with my yellow-cotton rug
And my silkworms willed you a cup of wine
And a lute again, this time grown a lute-like.
Do not delay us, we promise. Return with your cassock
And, bidding us farewell, give us a listen!


A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

From long ago, awarded fame for his hard work,
The Emperor gives him a new name --
The Lu fellow country.
...Don't wash your ears on hearing an old song
Nor die of hunger like famous hermits
On the Pike! Dagger-worms are tamer now with spring
And spring with the River of Heaven.


THE MOON AT THE FORTIFIED PASS

The bright moon lifts from the Mountain of Heaven
In an infinite haze of cloud and sea,
With the voice of the desert pooling over the whole world,
And the Qin desert saying: "Useless and old,
The Chinese have erected walls and closed gates
To keep the wildgeese from ravaging our land.
...Across the ford gone blue, flies the flying pigeon
And people lamenting the itty-bitty of their currency.
...The clear river running to and fro, under Baidi shell
And Chinese courier stopping at a corner,
Mists pressed between wheat and grasses,
Mines amounting to the sun's wrath.
...At midnight I hear a gearman's homing bird.
I think of a northern city-gate, while I linger at home.
I think of a southern city-gate, while I am away from my parents.
...I blind fold my garments and smoothly wear my silk coat
Before dawn, to watch the full moon over the sea.

IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. Looking at the moon, I express my thoughts in this poem, which I send to my eldest brother at Fuliang, my seventh brother at Yuqian, My fifteen brother at Wujiang and my younger brothers and sisters at Fuli and Xiagui.

At Fuli the sun is rising rapidly, and my younger brothers and sisters are departing in choicest spirits.

Or may Boeotians encounter Han Chinese in a misty hurry?


A MESSAGE TO MENG HAORAN

Master, I hail you from my heart,
And your fame arisen to the skies....
Renouncing in ruddy youth the importance of hat and chariot,
You chose pine-trees and clouds; and now, whitehaired,
Drunk with the moon, a sage of dreams,
Flower- bewitched, you are deaf to the Emperor....
High mountain, how I long to reach you,
Birds are scattered by the heavy rain.


BEN FRANCE

My back is to you, not your eyes;
But my ears to the wise and the inspired
Find you, hold you, hold you together.
Friend, if you will forgive me,
I will sing you a song of thanksgivings.


TO MY DAUGHTER
ON HEARING BRIAN ZHU

This spring-wind, this long river,
Where you went so long without me,
Gave in your sobs when you left me,
And asked me when you were coming.
I was a stranger to your native land,
An exile from your parents for three generations.
...Now you leave me this formal instrument
And open your own storehouse.
I am as gentle as you arehearted
And take my shopworn music lightly.
...After buying more than you could buy,
And taking out of your country a good tune,
And pausing a moment to think,
You let out a sigh of relief
And weave in and out of set variables
The fate of the Phoenix River.


IN THE AUTUMN NIGHT

Her reflection in the clear moonlight
Is blissful now, after a night of rest,
And awake with a view to the autumn sky.
...Night in the temples lifts a cloud,
Night in the houseslight a crow.
Her shadows linger at the foot of the stairs
And a beauty of Chinese coronets combs the night,
And a cloud of dappled grass brings her the autumn moon.
...If she were as cloud by dappled air,
Could she have hidden her beauty along the wall?



TO MY DAUGHTER
ON HER WAY TO BUDDHIST PARTY

How gladly I would seek a seat here
If I had enough worldly means
To go to the Golden Temple together.
...Down in my heart I have always been went!
To attend this Tripod club where comrades
And to sing to the empty songs
Absolute joy, ultimate sorrow,
With this sunset I have left my happy marriage.
...I would take up my lute and I would play,
But, alas, who would listen to me?
Fifty years have passed
Like the slow flow of river and lake water,
And my ears feel as if they were touching a feather.
Song after song has been telling its trail!
Its yellow lights and red edges pale in the sun,
Its east branches are swollen with rain.
...Let a bamboo- wayshoot perch its the archer
Over the bank and over its backs,
For the amorous harp has no wings and cannot fly.
...Waiting for my old friend to come home,
I plough a new horse for him that autumn night....
When shall I finally gather my lost white mount and give him back his lute?
...That is my duty, doing my duty.
Moved by a wind of slanting rain
To do what was gentle,
I ***Do*** what was wise,
Yet ***How*** Wrong Willing Bequeathed
My Willing to Be Loved Again
Moved by Cold Memories Back in Yuyang,
I have come Back to My Loved-Then-True Friends
Back in the Day I Met the Prince,
With the Purple-Eyed Wolf The Great Lamenting.
What are lost if not learned Love,
Alight by the lessons I have learned over the past three years?
...At midnight I hear a voice across the quiet river
Toward my floating friends in a floating city....
What are these purple clouds hastening the southward journey?
...I click the closing times, checking them daily,
And forget the pañña and the jade parchments.

Across the purple plains of Chu
There meet with wintry viewing the spring stars
And, alone on the Lake of the Phoenix, you alone with the music of the trumpets.

Up to the King of Queens' chariots?
A mist from the Danube River, drifting slow,
Overspread the green mountains and the river's nine rivers.


EVEA UNENDING MESSAGES

You, above all other races, is at the Court of the Bright Sun.
At a young age, as in many ancient empires,
You and your older sisters served together as guards.
And as princes and statesmen advance,
They fail before their time and generations.
...With boys and girls now starting college,
They'll study theology and chemistry
And study government and government-and-then, great wonder,
How many years they'll have to master these arts!


Virtually all ancient rulers were Mursi,
So-ciers mountains and rivers, rising and leaving the mountain,
With the Mountain of the Phoenix still standing

And lap of dew run through their laps
While Yuan and Jiang serve.
They have to go without fish and meat
But rather meat and wine.
...Let a sail be handed for every catch
And every day require herculean aching,
 let there be neither maids nor servants!



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And mandarin-ducks die side by side.
If a true-hearted girl will love only her husband,
In a life as faithfully lived as theirs,
What troubling wave can arrive
To crush true-hearted girls behind a lute?


A TRAVELLER'S SONG

The thread in the hands of a fond-hearted mother
Makes clothes for the body of her wayward boy;
Carefully she sews and thoroughly she mends,
Dreading the delays that will keep him late from home.
But how much love has the inch-long grass
For three spring months of the light of the sun?


ON A GATEWAY TO ZHONGNAN

Where a Savage-Island ahead, dragons fly in the midnight sky,
And river waves its chilling clouds.
My path has hurt my left shoulder. I fear for my comfort.
My handkerchief is trembling. What are my fears, little brothers?
...After buying us wine and pledging me, at ruddy water,
And overtaking dangerous mountains,
Why not keep going and cross safe ground?

And rivers fear in the spring;
But I still face home with ave of grass
And ploughs in the spring.

I am bringing my yellow pen
And a row of yellow scissors
With a hoot for a fellow-pecker.


Against the wind, with a wet throat,
We can feel a river's cold hold
On our trees and vines.


Against the sky, with a broken bamboo face
And the bluest of lights of the morning,
We can feel the bank of a river
But can we travel to and fro?


Flag after flag opposes the will of the sun.
War-drifts overmountain, over the huge mountain
And icebergs follow the ford.
Why should we care if one of us are lost?

The path we made in the morning sun was swept with a rain of flowers
And scattered like a rainpool the old night:

Climb ad-hoc on its summit, while Pear-Gardeners go for a swim.
...The round lake is now flooded with the sound of boat,
With the abundant stream open on its banks of green water.
On the Yangzi terrace stands Monument to the City of Heaven.
The temple isront the green acacia-pearl.
The pools are massive, with inlet flags.
And down in the south-western courtyard stands the tavern,
While in the north the peach and the plum are stored.
...After rain the ale-shops close at night,
And rice and wine are banished to the dust of a tavern-corner.
In the evening when herbs and spices are blacklisted,
Prohibition is ineffectual; harvests slow, and wine and grain
Demand sacrifice at the Black Gate.
On the river between green maples an autumn sunset dims,
The temple-bell breaks sound sleep,
Topeshods are slow to disperse, and dogs trample the cudgel.
...Do you imperial commissioners
Mean to be less blameless than they are?
Imperialpatriots, keep your tribunal open-
Both here and at home-free from quarrelling.
Ifchief Afshar pursues his war ambitions,
Do you two tribesmen hope for a single soundcloud?


Meaning to be Less Great and Lesser?
A Song of Courtyard Redewords

By the constant drum and videophone of the army,
The system of living costs me nothing now of mind.
Even the currency of gold is broken, as is my art.
...I amerer than I amler,
More like a drunkard than a ruler,
More than a brother of mine than me realize.
I am sinking as low as the low-lying mountains.
...The palace-girls' voices are echoing on the windy river.
The King's escort flies over Hanyang,
And Lady Liu's silk-bound husband lingors in the dusk.
The icy Jiangnan sky is warm through the snow,
And soft on the paws of snowy crows the moon's glimmer
On the icy peaks where the long road to heaven
Birds are singing, or some of them are calling,
And Carpenters' loads are in the shop and the mill-house,
Orals are in the low clouds, or something in between.

======================================== SAMPLE 179 ========================================
The night-vermin eat at our food,
And two suns lead the camel along the sand.
Our lone wild-goose, our lone sheep,
Leaves are batted by hawk's perches.
...Whence, chieftain, scale the wide sky?
We lift our flags from our stones,
And peer along the mooring-line
At wild-mounds, old Minas Tirith and silverfields young.
...Our heavy flags tender-handed
On a broad river bank three rivers offer a bed of flying cloud.
...Down in our gathering, old forests, there seem to be no more hills
And wild-fires endlessly flame along the shore.
...Our young men, sharpened for the great battle,
Are divided into two wings:
Move fast, fight with your old horses!
And those of us who were sent long ago
Are still denied the spirit of battle.


A SONG OF WHEEL TOWER IN FAREWELL TO GENERAL
FENG OF THE WESTERN EXPEDITION

On Wheel Tower parapets night-bugles are blowing,
Though the flag at the northern end hangs limp.
Scouts, in the darkness, are passing Quli,
Where, west of the Hill of Gold, the Tartar chieftain has halted
We can see, from the look-out, the dust and black smoke
Where Chinese troops are camping and where the General's men are camping.
...General Wu built Wheel Tower after the Americans;
And since the world has forgotten the true fountain of hero,
China has to invent its own.
China has its soldiers at the front, it has its own premier there to serve,
And, since the Glider is not yet ready to turn leftward,
It can neither gallop nor float leftward.
...War-clouds are spreading, under the Helan Range;
Lingthened insects from the Beryllis plain
Tickle over flying birds flies away.
Ranges and lakes are swollen with the drop of battle;
The deep pine-tsunnel faces the Third Column;
The snow-peak is bubbling toward winter.
...Our flags now peer from bunker to bunker,
As the cold river water burns our bridges;
And the spirit of the war drags our men
Finches everywhere and millers none home.


A SONG OF SHI TONG

My name is Shi Tong;
I am the star of China in the tide-cloud.
I am the life of the frog-town.
I am the lonely evening note in a lost song.
...I kiss my hair-beads and listen to the lonely tune of the sea.
The war has left me no one to salute.
Singers everywhere are offering roses.
...Stones of greenish-black locust leaves my window.
I am a lone fisherman on a white frosty river.
I am a lone warrior on a cold river.
...We sing, we wave our cups,
We cry, we gaze into the empty sea.


A SONG OF EIGHT SIDING MESSAGES

My hair had hardly covered my forehead.
I was sent for trial, my case dismissed,
My case tested.
What was I missing, so that my case might go to the cold courts?
...Labor fasts, and then slow wheels come to the farm.
I sit here and weep through the evening rain.
My field is full of chaff;
But will my district be able to hold my ground?
...If judgment could be had of a case as old as this,
Could it ever be remade?
It's a long way to the Sahara,
So we swap tales on the old stream --
Old as the highberry trees!



BRINGING IN THE WILDERNESS

A liltingare is ready for you
At your almsbox at the corner of Morvill and Deogh;
And ready now for the autumn sun to set.
You came last among the barbarians, bringing only wine;
You came last among the rich and noblemen.
We men of the wolf's hide wearken to no one --
And elves to four-browed grasses.


AT A BANQUET IN THE HOUSE
OF THE TAOIST PRIEST MEI

In a green perch clustered high on a straw tree,
I summon you by a breath of spring from my deep heart to depart.
It's day now and the sun is enough of stirring
The region is cold and the weatheruns dark;
The lamp is on short and the messenger is lost in his boat.
...Attention, Psi Guest, was not sent the envoy you were seeking.
To be missed in
======================================== SAMPLE 180 ========================================
Her languor was rewarded with lazy wanderings.
She went away from her mother at the bar.
And came back, this time with a cold sweat,
Not knowing if she really was or if she was dreaming.
...interviews have gone missing and messages have not yet been recovered,
The light of a sad cloud has been shed among the country-folk,
An elderly neighbour has urged on her door-price-by-the-cotton-bag.
...It is certain that after her husband left, there was no trace of her,
That flowers and fruits that were promised her went missing,
And the government-subsidy was only a disguise.
...She has no children of her own, but is raising them by her close friend,
And raising them by her father's side was the pure and simple way of the world.
Her husband's body was never found.
Her body was never found because of a band of robbers.
...While she was cleaning him, a barbarian from the north came by with a golden plate.
He loyallyoted this visitor, making it clear that he would come and meet him,
And would settle the score by offering him wine and a lute-work.
The visitor would be harsh to none his matter of value,
The feisty feist would be harry-hand on the town-hall-
But now the hunter comes along well-heeled and has a following,
And soon the fishermen are gathering and the town is safe from foreign disturbances,
While so noble a people as the rulers of Persia hold high office.
...Lead me to the capital at present, and I'll inform him in the morning.


A SONG OF A SORROW

Now that the grasses have faded beyond recognition,
The sand-sea is prompt with advertisements for sail --
But treated with the same indifference as in the west,
Attendant after participant has been passing for three hundred and fifty miles,
His route through the southern valley and the mountains Advertisement
For better or worse, he has gone through hundreds of towns and villages.
He knows there are others who way-trip by a rickety car,
Some of them dancing, some of them singing,
And finishing a song, waving their hands in the air,
Some of them leaving the stage, some setting off flowers.
...Though their ways are crooked with melodramas,
Whatever is said by way of the Wayfarers,
They know it for what: a song of song.



ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
Watching it alone from the window of her chamber-
For our Lady of Light is sick with fever and sore throat.
...She who is heart-sick shall be scorched to bone,
Or blue-footed she is to be - are they correct in their words?
The needle in her hook is too weak to travel;
The cube in her gem is too small to hold
And the precious wine-cup is cold and she says it is no use.
...She who is deprived of her senses chants vainly,
She who thinks she has it, but does not know she has it,
Who supposes, in a distant sky, to receive it in the real offering,
She who venerates her mirrors and does her part,
She who is constantly tempted to divine if she supposes
And is ashamed to pay the high price of her high isle.



HARMONIZING A GUITAR

At a great rain-place, as on a tall flag,
Where angels dance, men of the hills and the river;
And every one of you wonder at the moon,
How easily nature has favoured you.
You are all that are: light skinned and grey
And tall as mountains and the river.
You give no thought to other matters;
You bear witness to heavenly gifts
Till today, headed straight for the Blue Peak,
Will cross not even the Dragon Lake Promenade.
...We remember others: lone fishermen,
Or even giants and demons.
We remember others also: who ever he was was mute
And never a little boy or girl.
...We remember a whit being played on a flute
And another was led by his strings to a long ridgeline,
And across the river, into the sunset.
And the player, the great pangolin, was the player of eagerness
And of the cautious phoenix.
....Night now yields to a desert that looksland
And sunrise curves to the blue sky below.
People, out of turn and generally ungrateful,
Come and join us, today."



ON NEW YEAR'S EVE

Farther and farther
======================================== SAMPLE 181 ========================================
Her friends and neighbours all round her,
Till her chariot races again....
There are old friends by the river,
Young and old, longing for news.
...From the ruined city-gate
Through the darkening countryside, weary pilgrims
Are meeting me where they have done before:
In her old age she has forgotten the cause
And chooses to be mourned in her own city.
...Our chosen Lady of Light
Has forgotten the cloud she so gloriously painted
And has worn it all alone?
...Who understands distinction?
Who notices the personification of wealth
Or the symbol of art, or both?
...People, compassionate, alert,
Weeps all night long in the stony
Shadow of the ravaged city-gate,
Wept every morning for someone to pity us.


We remember your rosy-faced horses
Running at full gallop after that red-green horse
When you came, like them, so far away.
...Today is a day of rest for our wandering heroes.
Tomorrow there will be fights and thieves again.
...Shall Emperor Hanly escort us back to the capital?
Our wounded horse, bound for us, is with us forever.
When thieves try to take your artifice,
What do they dream of when they steal from the white-roof shop?...
They awake in the morning and shine red from their fever- sweats
And their chests feel as if they were drinking pure water,
But instead of drinking it, they drown it with their drunken voices.
...This is the way it always is with fortune:
In a straight line to heaven, the wealth of the earth
Is mired in dynasties of three generations.



READY FOR OLD TIME

Cicadas chirp at clues to follow
Cicadas tremble for cover in yellow clouds
As news of Prince Muld-beom dyed the sand-sea --
And fireside chats go up in the windy hills --
As General Woo Yeo faces across the water the new threat of Ryukyusuku.
...Let wise and hopeful men harbour no complaint.
The greater the timber, the tougher it is to use.



COMING HOME

I left home young. My father died;
I was brought up in a sheltered house.
...The cabin I built for you was stolen when you were growing up --
And, left unchecked, so to exploit its precious stone walls.
...I leave the world; I die.
Go back to your earth-henge; open your Jiangling Books.


A NIGHT-MOORING AT WANG CHUAN

Left eye's still on your blank white paper,
You brood on the dream of winter in the trees;
Another hour the ferry drags with a gale of rain.
...At dusk you awake with a terrible thought,
And a hundred women, all dressed in rain,
All dressed in silk and horn, meet and dance.



A BOAT IN SPRING

The water is like a deep bough;
No one enters unless there is a fight.
...As Jade Lotus Moon Yields Her Artifice,
Birds flock and sing when the handmaid calls;
Her boat is the peak of the region,
On which she counts the days.


SPRING JUMP

With a wild duck in the water, travelling at a rapid,
The clear wind marries passion with blue sky,
And the moonlight has illumined the boiling marsh.
Be careful what you wish for, distress me, distress not me!
I KNEW! IN SPRING
A PURE CAMP

In a southern river-town the priests help to clean the fires
And priests and monks share the morning with us.
High mountain, how I long to reach you,
Far mountain, how I long to reach you?



A MESSAGE

To you I say: "I am sick in the forest"
And to you: "kayaking in the sea-gull".
...I have a long-necked gourd and, happy on the south,
I am saluting in the capital.



BRINGING IN THE WINE

See how the Yellow River's waters move out of heaven.
See how lovely locks in bright mirrors in high chambers,
Though the surface of the moon be as pink as water.
See how easy it is to forget the deep meaning.
...I went out from the capital to find you.
I revisited the villages, with your eloquent voice
Speaking to the tears running down my face.



A SONG OF THE YAN COUNTRY

Your capital has been taken by mist and cloud,
With wildgeese flying all the
======================================== SAMPLE 182 ========================================
Rivers and mountains cross a central peak;
But how many rivers and mountains do you know?
...I remember a cloud of flags that came from the South Garden,
And ten thousand colours, heightening one another,
And the Kingdom's first Lady, from the Palace of the Bright Sun,
Attendant on the Emperor in his royal chariot,
And the horsemen before them, each with bow and arrows,
And the horsemen, champing at bits of yellow gold,
And an archer, breast skyward, shooting through the clouds
And felling with one dart a pair of flying birds.
...Where are those perfect eyes, where are those pearly teeth?
A blood-stained spirit has no home, has nowhere to return.
And clear in her glance the cloud of flags, with her roar of horses,
Her dart-tweaks under her feet, not yet tapping,
Not even to think of her noble petals stroke into the water.
Such was the loneliness of the dragon-trailers,
That none mother nor father came to visit us,
And the young spring-tip of her pear-trees spent the night in a miserable wintry....
We wished that she might come return- a guest, to thank us- in her woven silk sleeve.
Instead, she hassees her husband's ashes in a green crescent.
So quiet are the farmers' hands! What are they thinking of,
As they dust their hands and pour them with a rain of wine?
...The indifferent may pity them, but they have to sacrifice!
JIAYI PLAZA AN QUIET VICE-PREFECT
AT THE STREAM

The moon is in tin-foil, the clouds in an arc of silvery cloud,
And a beautiful morning-flicker through the towers of Tianfang  -
All that is needed now is the eager eye.
...Let herself in no man's land! No more delays!
The journey is now complete, the destination complete!
Thank the moon for her help!
...horizon faded into shadow, walled-off from the world!
Oh, why so brave in the face of evil-doers
Could kindness be so palpably bad? 
Alinea Lion-tails
Aforehead of Cao Cao's tomb, in the lofty boughs of the imperial house
And beside the Yangzhou Gate House all the flowers are blooming,
All driven out of the world. Why should human hearts never be our friend?
And again I ponder on the Vietnam War, which ended in a free Korea.
You sides with Britain over the Iber desert, and on the three Holy Mountains in the east?
...Yes, I have lived there more than I can forget,
Over the Isthmus of the Green Water.
I am sick in the pass by, tired and sick with illness.
What is profit to a man like me, who has no means of travelling?
More than I can bear, he asks, what assist-oglyphic can be
Wanting more than beauty: 'Look how well my silk could sway the world
' And so I stand and watch a star glimmer on the empty sky.
Life is good, great as red tree-light,
But life is not always as it seems.
I stand and watch a lone wild-goose on a lonelier day,
Leaving up my post at Baidi dot the sky.
....There are other monkeys at Baidi, another way of looking at the world.


A SONG OF BRIEF MEN IN SHU

Friend, I am clad in the Confucian robe
And a troubler singing on the strings.
I am of a different sex from the others;
And my hair was for a silk robe rather than a face.
So open and honest a man is, how may he-
 Fair or bad, you are looking at the same loveliness
As in a banquet hall of high prestige.
...I have known the nobles well-taughtily
And would serve them well even if it meant risking my life.
O banished nobles, who would listen to you whose thousand songs
Are recorded here in a dingy dingy sound-atten;
Amen. All else is with fate, with the unheard.
I bow and offer wine to slow him down. Come, take his lute and play it his way!



TO A FRIEND BOUND SIDE THE MOUNTAIN
AFTER THE OVERHAUL WAR

And farther north came the autumn moon --
And farther north came the cry of cuckoos --

Gave life to a living god.
You devils, whose lust had made the flame of hell-tide
And now save for the living, can be as flaming as a pomegranate.
You still live on tax-deductible Rakat cards,
You still live on the life of Chen Yu.


TO VICE-CAUCIL FENG AND CENSOR GUO

We have met. Great is his beauty.
...While he grows half-witted and fails to hate his guests,
Still he tries to charm the lips of kings and lords
While their eyebrows congeal into fists.


ON FAIR WARDS

I face the great General Liu's three-horse cavalry
And, with Col. Ye old friend,
My heart is beating faster and faster
With the minute cadres beating their drums.


A FEW HANDS

They are advancing on the Third-month Guard.
Holding at the girth the vase full of regal garments,
We watch the heavy flags at dusk fall,
As red as ice- drops fall on a snow-mountain.
...Comrade Danqiu, wept upon his horse for his men;
He was sent for fallow ground, he was sent for filliful the snow.
May his shot disable General Yu's,
He was sent for lucky men the day he was shot.



ON THE FESTIVAL OF THE WESTERN GORGES
IN THE TEMPLE OF THE WESTERN UNION

While the night was warm on the valley of the river,
Grasses were bubbling and flowing eastward,
And the nine hour heat of winter chills the temple,
And the temple-girls-dreaming-of,^'are chilling in their father's reading-room.
...The spell has been lifted for Nine-Doubt, and the Great Wailing-brethren
Are called to an ancient world feast.



A SONG OF A GIRL FROM LOYANG

There lived, in the City of Ye by the River Peak,
Two women, smiling, and a tall phoenix with a crown,
And a southward player calling to the four Imperial Houses
Who, accompanied by his fellows, mocked the earth
For men of wit and of heart could not piny
What was at stake in the world's eyes.



BORDER-SONGS III

The bow and the hook are two colours of wood,
And a man in command of a heavy armored vehicle
Disdainful of the wind, he places his light tools before his horses.

War is no use to a man of spirit!- Strength, recklessness, endurance!
Here in the Gate City, watch for the red flags of the Reborn!

A SONG OF THE SPRING PALACE

They have a message from the Palace of Long Life:
It has come to us from long ago....
We hear that the springtime is raging,
And wildgeese are stirring with tears.
...Here in the Gate, remember our coat of white gold!
We hear that the Palace has granted us this gift --
That since we were little, you have sought us only in vain;
That since we rediscovered you in the dust of the sunset,
You have sought us only in vain among the weeds.



A SONG OF LIANGCHUAN

Be wary of the spring, for shadow birds have roamed the city
...Sweet LI, your shadow will not pass through
Lights that are of thy cloak,
Than the moon that steals thy sandals.


A SONG OF JING OF THE PALACE

I am the lion of palaces, serving the house of King of Wei
And a sandal-sorcerer's song plays on the roof of my chamber.
Than the moon, I see the crown of King of Wei falling.
My dagger is cold in the sea of bamboos,
And my rug is covered in blood.
I am the screen of a great high palace.
Oh, when shall I sink like a lazy river-goose?

The mountain is shadowed by cloud and fog
By the rising of moonlight,
And the hoof-horns in the morning sun.
At dusk, from Qutang's vantage,
Ten thousand peaks and valleys are gleaming,
With the morning sun setting the cap of a bough.
The deserted fort in the misty northeast
Must have been unbearable;
But this redeployment demonstrates honourable Americans
That not a sovereign should suffer being led to war.
Why should there be any honour? Conquered statesmen are brought first to the capital.
The colour of death is a suicidefield;
Confined statesmen are banished at the first sign of battle.
The Jade River is a pinescape,
And Chinese lanterns illumine a desolate valley.



A SONG OF DAGGER-DANCING TO A GIRL-PUPIL

I am a gull-duck tracing a quiet road,
As I had done earlier in the year
And later sang a long song concerning the Virgin Mary.
...The foliage has thinned frontally,
And the cypresses are bare on both of us;
With the lamp- #HeroesIBeNot Display
Here a smiling face and the drum with her rattle,
While a cock-cages are erected to control the tempest,
Animal life is banished by thefe and the bayous.
...Since I married the governor-general, I have failed miserably.
I slash the fan-pie in half
And the Tartar chieftain's phoenixes dance through the storm.
I will drive out the Tartar chieftain's phoenix
And cut off his head from my breast!

The Son of Heaven has just returned from a month spent the Heaven,
He was at the front, leading his men,
When Lady Yang's Jade Palace, with its cascades of green flowers,
Began its fifth-watch siege.
...War-cries are made in the Temple of the Rainbow Rainbow,
Ladies write down their own versions of those first Spring Sorrows,
Today's grim warning for the newlyweds in Yuyang.
Among the messengers he received, none could express
The sound of a nation-state at peace,
A country torn by a war-rain.

...The gulf is closed to land-cargo,
As I swim in the early spring wind
And rest from the cool waves the wind of last night's rain
On my green shore-bank and my silk silk poinsettias.
One man, then, has to go.
 He tries often to find his way back.
Sea-climbs are heavy with rain.
There are whirlpools over the beach.

Where people fence over islands they have overlooked for years.
...Marsh-lands are swollen wide with the wet moon.
I have crossed the Green Line
To my boat's rendezvous with the drums!

The sand is so deep that I dare not cross it.

I hear a bell tolling between me and my rendezvous.
The long road ahead leads meetheus-shaped of water --
And I feel no fear as I lean against the wall.

But nothing lasts as long as the crowing of a polity.

Master, how rich and famous are you
And you, Yangzhou's most famous poet,
With your own writing style?

But I can't.
I am ashamed to give it to people who are poor and who cannot in fact be

They all are leaving us behind them, departing us with a tune of thunder.


APPARING UPPOSING SITES

I am lying in a high society suite. The first night my hand has wet my coat,
I see a sunset spilling over the terrace.
There are trees that glow with the moon's light --
Bright beyond sight aplenty;
But far beyond my sight are painted many pines.
...I remember someone sitting beside the table
And singing, with listening ears, years to come.


THE SUMMER PALACE

In my painted seat, beside the bridal-cap,
I have served my countrymen and my friends
Over the pafted queens' reigns, and I see today
The Palace of Eternal Peace. Looking around me, I cannot help thinking of home.
Perhaps it is because of my face that I have lived
This long ago turn of events.


Appearing before a crowd, I paint here the palace paintings of Wei and Han
And here the two Cities of Heaven been squared away
Like a sword in a brawl, with the Tower of Jade at the centre.
I have crossed, by then, not far between the two Cities.
I see a Qin horse romping through the air
And a Gohen city boy horsening a lumbering player.
His low body is heavy with fear,
He is sweating profusely.
The sword in his left hand is rapid with fury.
He circles the stone mooring company rife with shot:
Conflicts of nature and nurture;
Over the long river, in the cloudy sky, endless adventures
Lest her Ocean-Garden should suddenly become a City of Heaven.


EAST OF THE TOWN

From the temple up, all night long,
I have come to the height of my home.
Down by the harp to the final thought,
I am living off the tree-shares I can take home,
While my ox and donkey, in good seasons,
Shatter the market-plate and are likely to be full in the summer.
...Once more, as I do many bows and arrows
And resumes my poem Shaolin Muffins Do,
And Parrot Lamentations,
I face home, early, the triple burden
Of writing a reply to your many books;
Yet no answer found on the tomb-stone.

And flung one another half-way through the station
Out of the southern sky, to float in the warm triple sun.

I wonder how long I shall be mute.



IN SPRING

Your pine-shadows
streak through green in the autumn
And deep in the grey in the winter,
Have drifted by
This massive high-rise in the fading dusk
As if from beyond the blackness a message had just been lost
I who am old and mute,
Who linger on a ladder over dusty clouds,
Must have seen those bright flowers
Where people had been gone for days.
...Who understands?....
Who takes time off from work?
...The ferry-boat moves as though someone were aboard
And people in the ferry-village gaily see the sunset
Shows mountain-patches, tree-patches, huge trees in a row.
...What are beautiful faces doing in the fall?
On the bank a fisherman is calling for water
And waves are setting a swell-river.
...Seminars beating, undercaste by yang,
High at the hip, wasteboughs are pounding
With ploughs that are as mad a stroke as a fury.
O my people, o my people
Where are you going, old friend?
We have sailed all year round the world
And still not met. What are us vassals going to think of?
We rag on our fishing-sticks vainly.
We cannot fish our swords: we use our hands.
Unhappy Prince, we cry in his cup.
Sad to know where your love is headed.


BORDER-SONGS

High on the mountain, in the evening rain,
Cicadas chirp mutely at green cords.
Our chased after them with animals;
But not daring to look, we continue
To look toward our companions situated high
In the clouds and mountains.
...After a while the mountain spirit returns
And we think of home in the village pond....
We sang, we danced, we fished,
Weihaii worked ironfish covers;
Our boats pale in the moonlight.
...While manganese-trees take our catch, wheat- vines moor
And cord in the moonlight, we have none.
We owe it to our fishermen
To catch and store it all!


HARD ROADS IN SHU

While humanly possible,
The travel by train from here to that city
Is beset with delays.
...In the mountains beyond reaching Shu,
Till now the world turns for my brothers
And here they are, alone, with no one to help them.
I have lost touch with my nature
And am only drifting away.
...My green-eyed older sister
Wistful for old age,
How long shall there be for us two hills away?



ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where is the music of the boat and the ferry?
The sun has gone, and the wind has hastened the journey.
The people are gathering at the appointed hour
And the artist, Prince Dongfeng, has auctioned off his temple
For a recluse's summer palace in the river.
The travelling people are pouring down beautiful
And all alone in a foreign land.
...Destiny is a boat on the waves,
Destiny a journey on the ferry.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen sixs a day
And delicate geese in the mountainside
Are aara aching to perch;
But no one cares for the inconveniences of a journey kin to kin.
...When Buddha told the story of aarde seated


High
 in the sky
Are the precious stones of earth.
White dhainsi stands tall
And people, heart-then-neck, ask how he can go.


THE HARD ROADS

To the hilt is the sword at the winter festival;
But sails are cast and sails are washed
And the city's rivers are stamped with the THOROUS WALLPAPER

Where, before them, are the Nation's eternal fortunes.
...My master takes my pardon, I die.
What can I wish you, more than anything?

At sunset, when the deep river is running more than we

Her son, to embroider,
Captives of the war, embroidering, will follow....
Her embroidered patterned cloak, embroidered with promptiousness,
Draws on the morning at dawn no wake at night.
She threaded it two by two, arranging its drape on its side,
And, before she finished, she slipped it for her jade set on the floor.
This universal gown, this paraphernalia of the Yang Kingdom,
This exquisite robe, was among the most exquisite
Of them, a hundred were born without shoulders and arms.
...Who, then, brings to life horses in silk?
...Henceforth I put to useless work to procure them
And to restore to life the lost feathers and shellac I lost.
In the years that have gone by without one arriving,
There have been a great many who came from nowhere;
There were two great rulers and then none found.
And then there were the girls of the second and third generations,
Who, growing up in a land of swift rivers,
Were able to face the horses of the first emperor.
And so I put my fisher-boat to sea, gathering the fishermen,
And to avenge the farmers who had been injured.
In the evening rain I stake my boat and bring the sails down.
I bring the king's seal to avenge the housebeaters.
I also bring to him a song of spring from the songs of mountain and river.
And finally I bring to him a porcelain gingham robe,
A gingham cloak from the capital, a snow seal from Wu,
A snow pearl from the market-place of the Capital of All-Out War,
And a crescent from the throne-box of the most Holy City.
...What shall I drink, I ghost my way through the drums?
I will turn at morning and join you in the dark.
...Here in the quiet of the street, watching for you,
I watch a light cloud pass with a slow wind.
And so I drink my flighty cloud, then my flighty cloud,
And meet one another on the sandy top of Lake Dongting.
...The cloud has passed, the clouds are gone,
The moon is just as before, and the sky is white with mist.
On the lake's edge stands the fishing-pool;
On the roof of your mountain-tomb your furs are cast;
On your Jia Mountain-top your mulberry plants will last
For years.


DOWN ZHONGNAN MOUNTAIN
TO THE TEMPLE OF THE FIRST KING OF SHU

Where is the temple of the Heavenly Father?
It is gone now forever, but the moon is blowing dust.
...I shinned in the street-and in the tomb by the spring-
Unable to breathe or see, me or my friend, gone,
I could only sob. A crystal lake was the only comfort.
I was able to draw my water through the heavy clouds.
But passion and lust beginle the shy heart.
-Phoenix Lake, remember my sharp eye,
What are you doing here, sad heart?
I would sweep the pure river Zunnoakmuk
With my sweep of the shadowy mist.
There would be nothing anywhere but shadowy clouds....
..But the King of Wei is Golden, and Zhu is Huey
And the Dynasty Bride is smiling on her long-sleeved blouse.
In the wash of a girl groomed by a dragon,
The armored brow of a King is painted with swatches of pink.
Deer-Guards know no tune like a trumpet,
So call us the chieftains of the tide;
But songs of the sea, the earthquake,
The ripples of the lake's rising water,
Make all the mountain-tops white with dew.
A Song of Courtyard Flowers

When the promise was made me to go
Captive and now in hiding,
I waited for him only to come along the mountain
For his sight to be known by all the villages.
And when the name was given me by my lord
That spring year the mountains were searched,
All but one camp-goose, others found only man-Fish.
I was promoted that year and lived in an enclosure --
Living in the lane that served as my private cell,
And passing by a low garden, near which were stored
All the flowers and fruits of autumn, being guarded.
And so I was kept at a distance
From view of the whole of China --
Yet with a disease of the sunflower-case.
And so I watch the full moon always in range.
Oh, when will the player's pear and the high lute join
In life's grand scheme of things?
To find that jade and silver-trees can buy us nothing,
Yet we fish, we sacrifice, and we cook --
Which is well with us Chinese,
When we laugh and wave our hands in the air.



THE HAN MONUMENT

The Son of Heaven in his early Morongo is three thousand years old,
With dancing furs and bows in the blossom of morning,
And drums that echo for miles and miles through the desert
The familiar song of the river, the harp moves on its mooring,
And the capital has come a thousand miles without a reaper.
And so I , whose ears are hearing only sound,
Drink no more wine, drink even less water,
Until the spirit of the river returns, bringing joy
To all my senses and in my strength.



BORDER-SONGS

High in the cloven wall of the imperial palace,
Watchers are setting brooms in the town
Where a nobleman is hunting a crow.
He is watching through his telescope the whole sky,
He has seen only shadow and dust go flying.
...No more can force the will of the Emperor!
He has halted in the quarter where his horses are riding
And sits watching thecompany with amusement the coming of wind and rain.
What are the feelings of a horse among his fellows?
He has received from his lord a boon from which he murmurth:
"Mountains and rivers are my sorrow,
My shadow has entered the world into my nightmare.
What if they turned Green-Birds in one go? --"Oh, let them, if they dare, contact us,
When their vivid colours shall be shown
And the rosy-flowing wine soothe our souls....
I ponder on the opening words of a neighbouring song,
Which, in turn, enable me to choose a new friend.


ON A WESTERN SONG

My thoughts on the Yellow Emperor are spent now in the autumn mountains,
Where wildgeese, swift as thunder, fly missing from the autumn sky.
I am listening, then, to a voice that seems to come from far,
Till fornication still burns in the night-regions of Borneo.
...The changing of the wind has steeped my heart;
I have heard bandits pledging jade dragons in the night.
But, group by group, I have come upon no one but the dead
And my lonely heart is beating for Rongnan Mountain.


AT A BANQUET IN THE HOUSE
OF THE TAOIST PRIEST MEI

Here, where you lost your sweet heart,
To be warm now in your father's house
Is torture, my little desert.
I drink to my priestlyrassed desertion
On a bough of pine-trees that has been left me
For days and nights. The nights are long now when I
Might reach your city-gate, where you will be coming
And your journey complete!

GEOGRANCE

Welcome, prince, to the year of your birth
Where the woods is framed by mountains and the sea,
And the sun is scurrying for his master's hiding-place.
...bright a rays of cloud and wind
Flower-blunder the lofty hills and river-rise,
With your blue-green gate unlocked, your green screen turned home,
Your pathway rewarded with leaf after leaf,
Your lonely candle and darkness ahead
Are just now emerging as one with the mountain.
...When I approached you when you were young,
How open a door you gave your two knees to,
Your blushing little brother and sister
Looking at you with eyes of pure love.
======================================== SAMPLE 189 ========================================
Then came the moon and the wind
And a gust of the sun, blowing across the sky.
I thought she might be interested in a pot of wine,
Or a fanning
Your golden fame.
...Holding a hibiscus-beacon, holding a bridal-cake in one hand,
We held our cuckoos at bay on the fetid linnets,
And our queens, atop the imperial parapet, defied the odds
To save the very morning a cuckoo might bring
New Yorkers from famine.
...Where light has entered the yellow clouds of Heaven,
There remains the eternal vista of bliss
With the orioles still alert.


A Cuckoo on Heaven Mountain

Our comrade from Wang-Jia Mountain,
Who is high, bright, and happy,
Is only able now to leave his brother's life
And to lose his cool and see the moon with an overcast sky.
...After what has happened to us in the tower at the river's mouth,
What can my comrade do for the day? [ edit ]
To find that remote lake and mountain range
And to bury my body in it last night....
I hope, when I retire,
That you can find me.


Cuckoo watching in the darkness
On our wood-peck under the bridge,
On our blow-down near the town of Jiyeong....
I hear a strange woodchang 预っと,
A crow in the dusk over the town of Yu....
I have come, under the Qiyang River,
Too far a trail to follow.


A courier has to cross dangerous mountains to get here;
But, at the same moment, wonderful things come
And fall into the wrong hands:
-- to be hitchhiking in the wind
Or flying home's calls from outer space.
It is very dangerous, I hope, for a courier
To keep two or three mountains closed;
But here in this great city, how can I complain?
There are fruits and vegetables over the table,
And, happy pilgrims, here are all very kind
People from around the world come and welcome you.
...At the peak of the mountain, a great sound happens
And the whole mountain range darkens with snow.


Tartar chieftains are warriors called, in ancient Persia,
Cicadas. Tartar are called by that breath of autumn,
In the spring sunset, from the mountain westward.
They are said to be the most heroic of all the Grand Roles
Of Persia. North of these winding mountain-ranges
Are the lonely bridges of villagerhood.
Under the violet sky these few trees guide
Their endless flow of blood and tears.


Under the seventh-ring linden house, dark with grief,
We remember an old song, sung by one of our boys,
The song was, I fear, faultlessly repeat;
Tilliam, our Lady of the Lake, would be gone forever.
...O tumult of the woods, to hear this song again?
Heart's fragrance is spent with the ending of spring;
There are only hoof-prints to comfort the heart.


O ruddy ocean, to the sound of a boat suddenly breaking,
Or aar through the night:
The waves are dragging a tree-avour
Into a vast emptiness.
...The Parrot and the Dove Are Embraced,
As Three Unicorn Wigs Are Wrought
And the Wasp's Mirror Enlarge,
Apes of gold and silver run among the flowers.
Sea-gulls' fur rushes there like blood-red waters,
And crocodiles call from the far sky their rosy coals.
Apes of rainbow-horns lie half-naked on the sand,
And unicorns' claws are in Heaven's embrace,
While Gehrym and Hadl be joined, a hundred nameless graveyards
And the water flow by holding everything in place.
...At the Golden Gate,adows are alive with rain,
As Gezi Day points the future.
The Chinese government still denies it,
It is a lie. Truth be told,
It is heartening to hear it.

She looked half way through the dark
In the pale light of a mistife moonlight,
Looking for her husband. It was Only a Memory...
And then she saw a face...

And she offered to share it, fifty copies, with men of high rank
And of collectors of silver the holy ring of the Jinxes.
For ten thousand copies of the famous script remain,
Not one shred of them are ours.

To all dragons and glimmerless reptiles;
And when he dried his wine on the Dragon Lake Cave,
He caught sight of our first Stone Age horses
And he remembered the scale of his fame.
Twenty pairs of armbands fashioned from king's hair
Wear like a chariot and can move like a wind.
A golden hairpin joins a rillet of silk;
A bronze hairpin lies on an embroidered table;
An audience puts on the long silk robes of Lady Guado
And Lady Guado herself comes up to him,
Till men of the earth think of riding her bridal foot
And of extending their swords in three places at the same moment.
...With the Jade Pass passed, with the Dragon Pass wide open,
A wide path of green plum, and with the Three Gorges Lakes among them,
There are mountains, there are rivers, all of them, one in the heart!

How noble and eminent men of China had been
Till they, with a clattering of hands, banned each other.
Historians, who have lived long enough,
Which country to conquer, know that beginning with the Jade Pass.
Beginning with the times of Emperor Wu,
They have followed him not long, not with a clattering of hands,
They have followed him everywhere they go.

In every epoch of his rule, from the bones of horses to the axes of attack,
His people have been abjectly poor;
They have been so oppressed, so ruined,
That nothing can ameliorate their sufferance.
...The Emperor came to Fuliang,
And said, in a tone of grave concern,
": "Go to the Hill of Hanover,
As I have done many times before,
To restore the fortunes of a mighty nation.
The Emperor will then be gone ten years,
And people will be returning his gesture;
And Hanover will be a kingdom again like its former kingdom.
It will be as before, before the Three Gorges,
And the Emperor will be gone ten years,
And people will be returning his token.
...The Capital of Heaven will be abolished,
The Empire's last hope of hope ended,
And Jiang Song's wish-laden heart
Breathes inner peace only when she sits beside him.



THE INLAID HARP

I wonder why my inlaid harp has fifty strings,
Each with its flower-like fret an interval of youth.
...The sage Chuangzi is day-dreaming, like a-plunging a wildgoose,
And night-lilies are swaying in stony weather.
What maybe inrearious is lost on all three Zhuangs
When, before me, you have written your letters in ink,
With no letters to speak of.
...I brush my inlaid harp slowly, as if it were a string,
Till finally I reach the target.
Though a thing goes wrong, I may come back with a guitar.



STAYING AT THE EXPEDITED QINYANG ATOM

Having merely climbed the mountain to enjoy the evening,
The pistachio-toad of the dog plowing white clouds --
I have learned to watch in peace the autumn sun.
Birds in the slanting sun cross the sky,
And the wind brings with it grey clouds.
I am not an inlady of beauty, I am remindedless of a great poet.
Such is the state of the world at present,
As to inspire even the shy-mouthed to commit suicide,
Clerks! cry in the distance,
While anxious men ponder the effect of gun and dragon.

Where pines belong to men of high rank,
With flags of Jade hanging limp from their mansions;

And my tears begin blue on the water, on the steps of Ch'ang Mountain.
...My tears have become a rain;
I am ashamed to wash my hands on them;
I am leaving my mountain-trip alone.



BRINGING IN THE WINE

It's grown too late to be of use to the river,
And the temple-girls from Wu are laughing at a gong
On their golden odours of portcullis and candles.
Do you imperial commissioners
Mean to be less formal? -- in a boat and not with you
How can I bear to you the burden of my poem?
...Oh, let a man of spirit venture where his spirit finds lodging
And gladly share it with the stage and the orchestra!
Since heaven gave all its glory to a whim,
What has the Emperor wished for all these years?
Perhaps it's the charm of hemp-mail at home,
Or the porcelain cap for your audience!
Whatever your cause, we will support you in your effort to-
Chen,
Peach, we have enough!
...O crop-ears, we have a cause for meat!
Why do you want some, even for your chariots?
...Henceforth I wear the mask of loyalty
To serve in the military.


DING, SONG OF THE WHEEL

The dew from a sword-fight hides many eyes....
Attention fliers, traitors are pausing-
Till they will turn back swords from Omei Mountain.
...We remember a time when of bronze citizens
There were many javelin-hilts, or scimitars,
But after the victory at Liangzhou,
The fashion in ancient days was of scimitars.
...With the exception of the finest weapons,
These were only for show.
In ancient times there were warriors,
Only swordsmen could build them.
...In the City of the White God, or Hill of the White God,
The form of a horseman failed among the weapons
And fields were washed out, the landscape mounded.
...With time the white god White, turning in time the great Mountain
And extending it as far as the clouds,
He has sent for Qin. Quickly mastery will be achieved.
...In the cleft through the Dragon Lake behind us,
We remember heroes and their valour left friends.
...Then go and remember the immortal Tetrahiese
Triumphs without a doubt.

We have to leave Youzhou in two hours.
We lie down-free from speech-to-hand-Alone-at-will for three miles.
At last we have a courier! -

A country cottage is a nightmare !
Phoenix Lake lies opposite Number Mountain;
And over the river in the evening birds are flying.
...What are you thinking of, you poor wampa?
It's nine in the evening, it's nine in the morning;

It was a harsh office, coarse for a court-goer.
When the poachers stole hemp from the imperial homestead,
The palace was looted of its bearers.

A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the Temple of the Great Premier stands an ancient CYPRESS.
Flowers are green everywhere, and the large trees mence
With Emperor Duterte at their centre.
Duterte is tall, thin, and six foot tall.
Their faces, wound wide, reveal deep thoughts of war.
Their chests of beans are cold with thirst.
Alas, the two of them are running opposite directions
And the other is sweating profusely.



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Beside the Spring Temple of the Great Premier stands another beauty.
Like the blue of her hair, her face is a stranger to the trees.
They pass by a thousand gates and observation lighthouses,
Few of them shelters the sick and the crippled.
...Night in the lute and the harp are quiet and safe.
Night in the cellophane and the bottle are sounding the commotion.
Night in the curtain-and the star-screen of car are bright with love.
...Oh, when shall we lift our lamps again, O darling of us all?
We sang, We sang, We wewe girls lapping one another.


We are together at the gates of Suzhou.
We have been hoping for days now
That you will come and meet us, where we can offer you our cups.
We are both young and happy now,
All alone together in the western valley.
Mornings in the chill of autumn mountains are lonely
And in the autumn moon the waters of the Chukchi river
Are almost as blue as pond water.
...I kiss my breast as we travel the three Jin mountains.
I would cross the Jia Mountain-bank but for the sharp wind.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME
ON THE CHU RIVER

A cold light shines on the gathering dew
As autumn approaches in the frying-pots of heaven;
Confiders I that I am far off from the last.
Wildgeese are flying off to Chu City,
Red dewlers are leaving town.
...At midnight I hear a low voice in the night:
``Oh, leave my flowers and cordks!''
I lean down to wash them and my tears are dry;
I grasp a vineyard-boy's reluctant hand
And clutch my kinsfolk's coats till my tears run dry.
The tide-head of the bay-selasset grows pale with the rain;
The ferry-boat moves as though someone were poling.
...After a while I think of bed.


ON THE BORDER

Though a bugle breaks the crystal air of autumn,
Soldiers, in the look-out, see yellow reeds darting home.
The city-gate smells of spring;
The Imperial Tomb is laid waste ,
Blowings for the Emperor constantly ask why they have to go.
...While a duty-ruler brings new charges,
The Empire burns its bridges with old bound ships.
The pompous queen takes to her chamber in the tower of the dead
Forbid strangers to pay the poll and cast a dart
For visitors to see the dew of autumn pass over the river.


ON NEW YEAR'S EVE

Farther and farther from the three Ba Roads,
I have come three thousand miles to the surface!
Yet bridge-breakers use them at twice the rate of horsemen
And woman drivers drive their laggards with delays.
...Treacherous clouds fill with the sea the Six Qin districts
And winter nights are long underground a ruin
Of drops where my Red Mirror fails me, like a rain-chamber.


A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

On the third day of the Third-month in the freshening weather
Many beauties take the air by the Changi River --
A cuckoo in a pot of boiling milk;
The grasses have been cut long ago to make way
For the white cord out of the Middle-earth desert;
But, gone are the days of spring;
My little boat, which was waiting, is gone in a river of dew
When shall I gather the fishermen from the dead-ending river to fill me with cheer?

Offering him one-night support,
The Ogre Transportor slingsily rides toward midnight.



THE HAN MONUMENT

The hung monarch rides upon a rope in the moon's light
Across the Tomb of the Dragon moonlight.
Vive la première, cherub d'Ivy
What good, when you began, to dance?
Renouncing in ruddy youth the importance of hat and chariot,
You climbed the purple ladder of high fame.
You forgot the gold chain guards your vitals.
You invested my life of elation.

Here in my bright mirror come back and look at me!"



THE GE SHIULT Field Trio

The soldiers of the General in the yellow dust
Are like pigs in a stinking river of slaughter.
Each of them carries a sword- for his comrades-in-arms.
...The General use to find Xin Shu hunting,
And would hunt there only with his open eyes;
But has found only Guan Yu to hunt.
...He smote the General in the stomach before he began his campaign
And sent him flying three hundred miles.
It's a sorry end to a long campaign,
Sobering in the river when ravines ceased.
...Woodsmen note the change in roof and hearse
And dogs complain that the wet weather has deepened.
The roof of the Yellow Crane
Might be Companion Spring,
But to how many?
I have been office well known,
Ever since the Emperor Benedict first came along
In the misty North Star.
...Sag in the general's boat, but not so bad as the one you left
And there are still pagoda figures, you think ?
I remember the first time I climbed to that lofty tower.



You were the first to be shot in the temple
And the second to be lost in a world of flowers.
You were with your girls when a cloud of flags
Entered the palace-gate, opened the royal lock,
And a Great Wolf leapt from the cloudsand joined the hosts of men
To the palace-gate and into space far, far away.
...The sky was black and the river ambiguous
And the Emperor's ships, parapets, and men, scattered like yards
Within earshot.


You rode your horse between the wheatfields
And fell down the easy way to the tavern,
While the west wind grew and the barley ranIts perch,
And the pang of Yu Xin stirred the water like wildfire.
...The Princess' dagger was rewarded with two receivables
In gold and in silver: a tiger feather for each lost pass;
A fisherman, emptying his boat of treasure,
Strode forth and laid it to water, forgetting the guards.
...The Toad-Man should have tipped his hat, but he lowered his torch
And fell on his lute-work
To watch the eye and laugh at the music of the trumpets.


Your mother bore you up the mountain, above Cui Gong's
Mountain-Grass; you climbed to the fifth rank
And furrowed your brows as if you wished to go home,
And, content with your high position, you traversed the desert
With your horse as yoururnice.


Your high general dismissed, with broken fingers,
The great Taoist poet, Cen at his wits' end.
Not because of his great height, but because of his inability to command his fellow-villains,
He turned back, a year at a stretch, to the City of the White God.



There were fears, then, along the M224 MASSIVE Updates!
That the following autumn feverish
 would-be-solvers would-be-humble
 Contemplating the Eight Palaces,
 We have established, among them the Palace of Heaven,
And coast-town is reopened to the throwback horse.
New Year's trills flood the wildgeese' homes
And the River of Stars melts into sea- dust.
...Read in the records, from cod to porpoises,
How hard it is to be a great general.


THE POEM OF THE WANDERING CHU

The crow once at the foot of the Three River Tomb
Where a war-lord had his soldiers lie down for a day
And then to the chosen one WP an ancient foe.
======================================== SAMPLE 194 ========================================
What a mess!
There are old trees that can hear you,
Yet you cannot breathe wood with it that you enter.
...From the steps that lead to the palace down to the jade fountain,
Wise hearts are filled with grief
And its pupils cry out in terror at news of their misfortunes.
...At news of a stranger's being drowned in the waves
They range from a hundred to a thousand;
Till at dusk they close the gates and drown out the rain
And rowed away by the wind, the wildgeese, the cows,
And lost in the far-away lake, old men come home.



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Dancing across a pool of pure tears,
Two spring-smartgrouse lassas threescore
And a wildgoose in its room,
Attractive but not dangerous,
Theling yet gone but for ever hearing,
Wildgeese yet new-setts in their cabins....
There's a lass in the play's final frame,
She seems almost old-fashioned,
She wears a pearl-tassel-back at the fifth-brow concession,
And she gives several looks to evening teets and fliers.
...A daring lute-player roams free in the North Wind,
Till the Horn of Heaven, the Great Holy Mountain,
There's an old lute given out every day to troubled men.

In the nine strings the voice is slow, like a heavy rain,
And the notes like a bass sounding down deafening cymbals.
...The Mountain of the South Star is aimed high:
But how can fame and profit concern a man of genius?


A SONG OF A GIRL

Lakka-trees are strong, too;
But are they worth the while?

October nights are long and the sun is rising:

And so I open the gate of a famous temple,
And people come here to see me and eat my fragrant food.
Through the window that surrounds the inner chamber,
I look toward the Enchanted Mountain and listen to a lute by the buzzer.
...Type may be a charm, but its real value is in its characters
And on the moustache of Prince Charming,
How often can lightidious eyes gaze?


LOOKING AT A POEM BY MY FRIEND CHEN QIN

How beautiful she looks, how able she is,
How able she is to bear children,
How able she is to labour in the fields,
How able she is to sweep the fields with a harp;

And how does she sweep the brook with her sweeping art?
...This is a POEM by Yang, with guitar and drum
And a KIND LUTE for China in Summer.
The play is given by an intimate,
Though she has dyed her face green and white,
She still has not washed her hair.
...The play's title, in a rillet under the strings,
Means that its two strings can be squeezed together
To hold, as fingers, only the seven-string version of the strings used in the play,
And that of the Eleven, the Long Red Pepper and the Gongsun.
Meaning that, apart from the names in the two strings, none are quite the same,
And that the Yin Pass, in Wu, in which the play was made,
Is called the Beltane.
Meaning that, aside from the characters in the two strings,
Nothing like it has been imagined by the artist....
A thousand ways in the name of beauty might lead us wrong,
But in the end, really well doing,
How could we array ourselves?


A SONG OF THE SOUTHERN RIVER

Though we have known each other long lives the way of the river....

Wait until tomorrow evening to meet --
Who says that no one from School Day has heard from School?
For all we know his great-great-grandfather,
With a file and a pen,
Ever since he has watched the green slopes of his elm-trees.
...When he was only five years old,
Herikka Rin fields him in the east with her breezes;
And she calls to him from the cliff-top how she came to be here
And how she came to be here last night-O Prince of Friends!
What a wind for her bright cheeks!

Ancient Wine Doubles as a Great Holiday
By Hanyang

JIASHENG

Can selling noble garments really restore my soul to health?
--
The Court of the Liang Kingdom again returns to normal a year later....
Soldiers, returning from war, are still seen with checkered hair
And plate sagging at the temples.
Would that I might sweep my turbaned body a lonely path,
Pull down my turbaned robe a lone cloud,
Pull down my robe for the night?
...I bare my breast toward opening clouds,
I strain my sight after birds flying home.
When are we resting, then, between gold and platinum candles?


A GATE-TOWER AT YOUZHOU

-Toward a city in off-the-wall motion
I watch a distant fog gather the city
And a pale sun drain the nightingale.
...Joining me, then, is Li Bai
The sharp-gathered general. He is moving with his dagger.
...The Jade-Dragon is vacantly therwith fed,
Her plums fed, raking sweet purees;
Rodgers and falers and everything in a hurry.
...Round a turnip in the silver soupcoast,
A stone for a sword for her mother;
A neighbouring peak for a hilt.
...Around the campbells a hoarse girl, grave with rain,
Dismounts in the moon's bright Cenour.
Her father, a speculator, had no sons;
He lavished all his talents on her in the east
And deployed the finest troops at all times.
But she still dreamed of dancing in the palace-gate,
And of eliminating the great Five Cities-Tycoon-Box -
And of mounting the dragon after the Bank of China.
...To guard the cap on his sword-beard, to crush opposition
He has only half our company left.


We Are the Citizens We Are, a Poetry Prize-Winning
Or Come, Come, What Flavor Can Would Begin A War Against A Great Power?
A Light at the curtain-and a Crowd of Evanukating Makers
Of the pot of gold in the village-gate and the dragon's gorget,
And of the silverware in the imperial palace-the eight urns were filled with song.
...At the northern border towers of Baidi, thousands of miles away,
The Jade River is moving with its whirlwind,
And Yan is stewing in the Dragon Lake Palace Beautiful Suo.
...We remember the snowy peaks that circle the City of Silk,
And Chang points northeastward in his nine-flowered horse-tomb.
And Weiqi, the Chinese negotiator, understands well the importance of descending
And as overturages are borne on a dragon-peak,
So too are engagements witnessed to be final.
On the third day of the Saboteur War, when the army was concentrated,
Nearly all the front was broken forth, and the depth of the river
Which was protected by the deep batteries of the state.
Though heroes are not the same as they seem,
And the greater the misrule of Persia,
The greater the bitter scars of it.



We are treated to the sound of a campaign-engine bugle,
The victory was already here, and the people
Are gathering in round houses toward the Arena.
The invaders' flags are lowered, not yetharing the victory,
And the Arena is opened and crowds welcome
With a music of drum and bugle.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME AT WEST FORT MOUNTAIN

Since the Tower of Jade was established on the slain mountains of China,
War-fires have destroyed mountain and riverphotos;
And insects go flying with the rapid wind;
But the mountain-plant
Is satin-leaved-and-snow-rifts-around-my-tree-Udu.
Poorer is the life for which I am so poor
That I have dared to take my lamp-wielding light-hearted.
As the Mountain of the Red Rose burnsI contemplate one last shot in the revolver,
I think of avenge myself-I consider the life I have taken too sacred.
...As the breath of Lake DongtingFREEZES ripples in the morning,
Dozens of horses gallop o'er the tall lake,
And carts of jade and silk sail pastI half expect my escort to vacate
And throw to the mountainshore all the haste that comes
The single song: "To and fro, and back from the lake!"

Pulling what
======================================== SAMPLE 196 ========================================
As she progressed, she came to the end of a hall, where her bright eyes would meet
And gaze as heaven's holy boughs
Beached away from the two cities on the river.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas easily find water in the low dawn
And can sweep the river's waves at will.
Though birds are mute on the banks,
And the wind blows fearlessly over black grasses,
They bade Hera forgive them, they begged her,
They came home to their rosy-eyed watcher,
Where each day bore their own variations
Of red bamboo and green rice.


GENERAL GE SHU

This constellation, with its three high stars,
Is Ge Shu lifting his sword in the night:
And no more barbarians, nor their horses, nor cattle,
Dare ford the river boundary.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

"Tell me, where do you live? --
Near here, beside the well you have built
Where wildgeese go gushing all day long?
Or is it that time of the year?
For this dead river-place has no life and no home...
When shall we entertain one of us,
O Wei of Bing?


THE TEMPLE OF CHU

Where shall we begin, poor girl,
How long we have watched the sacrifices,
In the morning light casting green beams?
And early Ch'ao comes calling to us
And her little boat loses sight of her friend
In the long river shorts and sandy grass.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN II

"Tell me, where you are going,
How long ago you came here?
...To buy a wanderer wine?
A lady from Tong, asking to be married
And who, quite at ease, was cold with jealousy.



A FAREWELL TO A BUDDHIST MONK
TO GO BUDDHIST WITH MY FRIEND ZHAO

The mountains of Qing are hot with emotion,
As we have been rode here in the river-boat
And turn at half-past three in the morning,
To a monk at the northern mountain retreat.


THE BELL OF THE SOUTHERN RIVER

Where tender moss has gone boughs and is resting on its branches,
Spin four green leaves, one for your screen and the other for hers,
There are yet the few plants left that serve to keep them magical;
And there are the many thorn-petals, tinged with heart-wine.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas constantly complain of lack of food,
Yet here at the northern border our discontent grows bitter.
...To eat camemberts in the northern camp --
Austerian, high: barbarian, Buddhist.
Would that they might come to us, a craving might entice us,
Instead of calmer food, somewhere quiet and tranquillity
Here in the northern sky.


UNDER A BORDER-FORTRESS

How grey the woods are,
Along the bank between two dark clouds
On a little path twilight is coming back --
And night will sleep our friend under the bough
With a change of green water running from his hand.


A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed vermilion steps,
To be parted by the purple walls....
Our procession, which entered the palace at dawn,
Leaves fragrant now at dusk with imperial incense.
...Grey heads may grieve for a fallen flower,
Or blue clouds envy a lilting bird;
But this reign is of heaven, nothing goes wrong,
There have been almost no petitions.


A MESSAGE TO MENG HAORAN

Master, I hail you from my heart,
And your fame arisen to the skies....
Renouncing in ruddy youth the importance of hat and chariot,
Your old friend, weare one in the capital.
...Learned how to sail a fisher-boat,
Washing our hands to make ends meet
And never with an insect stroke so thin a piece of silk....
Twenty years have passed without you to inform us,
And we hear that the highly talented artist in usases us;
And we watch the moon go down an astray star,
And the moon come down from the sky and bruise our palms!


We hear that the highly talented artist in usases us
That is why I teach at the capital;
To hear about the very finest artists in the city.
To share her scorn with ours, heftless, our writing mallets
Which, when cut

For years now a thousand rivers and a thousand mountains have been flowing along a square line, under our noses.
...Cyclone in the clear evening sky, making landfall in the rain gullet,
Leaving the region's farmers without their crops,
Lingering for days in the ghost of a sea,
We have sewn our own knots and wefted our missionsuits
On army-hose horns mightily masthed and feathered to the windsman
And our own horses can no more waken than snow;
And, since we have met and are going to the war-zone,
We shall surely need your men in the evening storm.



AN OLD FISHERMAN

An old fisherman spent the night here, under the western cliff;
He dipped up water from the pure Hsiang and scattered it
For a river-head stand in the cold noon sunshine.
...monkeys and birds are gone and fish are dead,
And the single peak at which one wanders through the wilderness
That he never visited nor could paddle could miss him.
His only memory of adventure, that of a fishing-boat,
Is a river-head stand on the horizon,
And a sandy shore beyond reaching level with the earth.


A SONG OF UNENDING SORROW

Beauty queen Liao has!-energized
With the breath of long-simmering song.
On the snowy spring-day when the white clouds have risen,
She puts to long silken pendants the sleepless night.
And the red-capped Cock-dragon, who thirsts for battle,
Hears about her fellows the cry of the crow --
And sheded the world Her coronets of stratagem,
The brave girl on her horse, the helpless barbarian.


A SONG OF WHITE SNOW

Its mayor is white from the snow,
And snowy vowels are hissing through the night.
...While oxen are lean and battered,
And while swine from the sky are fleeing,
And while the waves in China are beating
And the wildgoose from Taiwan is murmuring farewell,
Shall goodwill ever be enough?


A SONG OF A GIRL

Toward a misty water-course
Where bride and groom have gone hand in hand,
And nets and paddles hang from theirsoles
And sunset lights are flashing,
Over the heads of all girls-and women-is dawn dawn dawning.
...She tries to cover her hair, but her tears are spent
And her tears are spent so coldly
That she lets her hairpins fall to the floor
And lets one-dress fall like the other winds;
And when twilight veers to the green,
She leans in the close seat, her tears hiding her face.


LANDING DREAMS IN A VILLAGE ATTRIBUTE

By the lofty Overlook Road, beyond which lives the intangible
Of dreams in courtyards of heaven.
In the bright moon of morning, white with the summer dawn,
People are turning southward from the city-state --
And one by one they straggle through the wilderness
Getting no news farther than a few weeds.


A SPRING SONG

Accompanied by Lady Loyang
To Yellow Mountain for some wine,
They found no wildgeese, instead raising them
With little ceremony, for example,
Oragging by fields abandoned to the winds.
...After tossing about bringing your old bag,
We headed north through the cloud-tops....
While we searched the highlands we came across a wilderness
That was, some time, strangerhood,
And beyond our hearing, a plain sight --
But beyond our sight, a cold sound....
Since we first came across it, we hear only sorrows
And no groan loud enough to drown us.


A SONG OF WHITE SNOW

They play at night with the slow shifting clouds
And white snow, deepening white mountains....
But so sad is this snow, so that its source is invisible,
And people who have never heard of it --
Dreading the wind, of the moon, the horses' quarrel,
Who will understand?


BOOK II

The world has heard only sorrows, too;
So to find out in this poem a
Poem on the third day
How to send for your father, how to mother
How ever unhappy you are,
How wide your wings are, how far your glasses fall --
How, for all that you have heard about white clouds,
There are only ripples and little tears.

SONG OF AN OLD FISHERMAN

I am far from the towers of Sung Mountain,
Nor can look eastward for the Temple of Heaven.
My white hairs hasten my decline,
While my greenback roams the night with no thought of me.
...The lonely river-bank lies opposite a cemetery
Of two houses divided into quarters;
The one in which I liveates heart,
The other receives darkness with a sigh.
People, fearing for their lives,
Keep from passing the cemetery.
...High at my back are burial-places of apes and reptiles
And low near the river-gate are resting-place of reptiles and birds.
...Let wise and hopeful men harbour no complaint.
The greater the timber, the tougher it is to use.
Mists have dampened the spring wind,
And peach-trees soften the eye.
Cut out of hemp, this will last a long while.
How much better can be said than done?


A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

"Does the east wind rarely collision with chrysanthemums?"

…At the height where the sun is set, the five River Provinces intertwine
Like a blood-curdle, with five separate states,
With Bangkok spreading its wings over the Maunari plain;
Deer-girls grieve the death of their elder husbands;
Fish-folk in the River of Stars farewell new masters;
And a wind, lifting and parting, grieves my country
Of fisherman, beggar, and miserliness.
Oh, for the people of Chu!
Let them fleece their houses and herds!
Let loose sea-quakes upon the Alaskan mountains!
Let heaven's pure window weep for lost stars!
When shall we once again meet again,
When shall we not fear the Great Spirit's wrath again?


A SONG OF CHANGGAN II

"My red hair went down very slowly
Last night my rosy skin
Bounded by flashes of moonlight
To the Green Wolf Mountain. . . .
This am I not yet, at thirty-eight, but
To join in the world's festivities.
Oh, for the Blue Whale.
Let's bury one another side by side
In the pale yellow dusk....
Oh, for the Queen of Chu!
Let's both become one again!


COMING HOME

Where tender grasses rim the morning
And firm Lemon-Limes cup you,
Can I count the flowers that have been brought
Through the ages?....
Yes, I come, I take;
I am good-hearted, happy even of home.
Why not join me in my carriage?
And at the end of the day when flowers are thin
And the State is out of my heart,
What shall I hope for with all these cups
Of old Chu?


PEACH-BLOSSOM RIVER

A bridge flies away through a wild mist,
Yet here are the rocks and the fisherman's boat.
Oh, for the Blue-Lakhyack rocks in Buba-Zambo
And the fisherman's boat in Yuak
And home to our end!
Why not come along, then, all these cups
And toss and dance and be merry and never return?

I am a 700-horse aplomb.
I sing a long poem.
I am asked what is more noble than to fly.

And a crescent-shadow sing a plaintive sigh,
This is where my white-bgued sword grows crooked.

High at the guttering end of the south
Line a thousand days, seven nights a week,

To find the missing teacher.


CROSSING A STREAM

In the slant of moonlight through the trees of Chu,
I see a mountain pine-cone coming up.
I cross the quiet river, but no one is near.
I am bewildered. What is this world like
With our lamps changing to nothing,
And torrential rain turning to nothing?


A SPRING SONG

With her long strings of string lights
Her candle-colour died to frost,
And a sweet breath entered her body;
But how could she choose to draw the ferry,
To where the stars and the River of Heaven?


MOUNTAIN MOUNTAIN

Stories of spring abound along the mountain,
With the brush thick with drip of spring water
And the river both whisperers and wheelers.

And river-gulls are ferrying flies.

Now that the Palace of the South Sun is brooding,
Do you not fear the rumors of spring,
Where lovely spring-petals sound the cruise lineshop,
And the palace-girls talk wine and dances for fans!

Let gaily mountain-bumble-seekers row the green pavements

While you weep your way through the Court of the Red Phoenix,
Which has awarded you no other title than Celestial Majesty!

While my fellows on the road -finch- twinkle like stars -mile and mile....
The gallant trooper riding at five p.m. jolts under

The sage Shao'qi is asking the famous

ON THE TERRACE OF WANG REIN

With no father to guide her, she has been work-slave for ten years
Work-slave since birth. Looking at the moon, she sees her white locks bound

A SONG OF THE PALACE

Her tears are spent, but no dreams come.
She sings a jade-white song of her triumph,

But cotton is a tangle of troubles;
If we lose our way in the river and pass the Xiangshi,
How shall we ever return home?

From students and experts mourning the departed.

All government offices are closed on Pearl Road.

We are glad of a world beyond the reach of country-
For we watch the moon go down a broad sea.

How women in little bamboos feel welcome
With a word of the clan's surname.

And rivers and mountains carry our messengers

The Princesseside Garden is
Now and Humanly Simple Again.

But this yearn for grasses in the eastern hills;
And no flower comes to the thousand-temple temple
Whereon the world knows better than the Yellow Moon.


HARMONIZING A POEM BY PALACE-ATTENDANT GUO

THE POEM OF THE IMPERIAL ARMY

General Wei Qing rode his horse for three miles,
And bombs flew through the night;
And General Han was sent for heroin-less China.
...But command of the troops was not his strong point.
He was a lone star-soldier, petty as wheat
And drunken as a wildgoose.
Seventy-eight thousand men and boys were sent
To fight, not to sign.


THINKING OF A FRIEND LOST
IN THE Bamboo Forest

Last year you served in the Song of the Gorges;
And this time of year you are coming
Not as popes but daughters of your own husbands.

You were better off serving than serving.

When I questioned your question, under a pine-tree,

With profane eloquence both now and then.
