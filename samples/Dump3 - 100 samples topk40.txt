======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
With the mountains and towns all but alone,
With the soldiers assailing the sky,
With the farmers tossing their pickles --
This town has become a dumping ground for pickpockets,
And the army dropping more and more on the waves
And, alas, is shooting only white feathers.


AT NANJING FERRY

This one-story inn at Nanjing ferry
Is a miserable lodging-place for the night --
But across the dead moon's waves its watersof pink and silver.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Now that the palace-gate has softly closed on its flowers,
There are only the river-waves and the wind of last night's rain.


ON THE TERRACE OF ASSEMBLED ANGELS I

The sun has entered the jade-white-and-glass-of-hell-blossom world
And gone the pent-crow's brilliant pattern;
No Buddhist, no Taoist,
There appear to be only a solitary watcher at the going snow-peak.


BEYOND SEEING

Where the evening smoke has moved across red carpets,
The Lady of the Lake retreats, with honours she hasselthed crocodile,
To one prince, a sad ghost is floating
In the dusk, under a clear rock,
Like a lost autumn candle, forgotten.



A SONG OF THE PALACE

Now that the palace-gate has softly closed on its flowers,
There are only the river-waves and the wind of last night's rain
There are only the faint pines and the quiet autumn sky.


BEYOND SEEING

Where the moon has entered the deep red-heeled meadow,
There is not one with the pearl-trees of Jing
Yet is there a lone pangrier rolling sweetly
Across the meadow, refusing to go away?


A SONG OF THE PALACE

A cocoon of jade is on the dais yesterday
Where bride and groom have mingled, enjoying the flowers.
...The morning-rain has gone, white with the flowery grave;
The dais has been cleared for flowers,
And flowers are gleaming all through the palace-oyer.


TO A FRIEND BOUND EAST

The old fort brims with red flags yesterday
And the new shaken bricks are rising again.
...To go back in time takes managing a country....
It was life's journey, full stop,
Once upon a time when fairies were worshipped.


IN SPRING

Your brother, in the mountains of Henan,
Is fling grasses at the wind and sun
And volunteering to go to the White Wolf Mountain White Wolf Mountain
To fly his Curtaneer over Lo Wu Mountain.


MOUNTAIN-CLIMB

When the tide-faces of the two banks are met,
How will they move through the turn of the wind?
...I am sailing, after all those hills and rivers,
With no idea of the world or of home.


MOUNTAIN-CLIMB

Now that the waves are rising even farther,
Where is the gathering of spring-song?
...In a sharp gale, like the steppes' in the evening,
The last insects of the field move with them....
And distance moves the wind like a rushing river.



EARLY AUTUMN

The far peak of Yuanhoa
Is being mended here by a ride of rain.
...There are lone reapers, tending gardens,
And the rich are bidding the poor to buy wine.
...Killing is rare indeed in this Geoghe age,
Yet fewer are captured and sent to war.
...Panting and looking through the large gate,
Not knowing where to turn, old age hunger-striks
Andises high and low with the sun.


AEROSPACE

At its westernmost point stands the ancient sanctuary
That has always been a temple unto death,
And has always been a shelter unto fever:
Yet now the hour of dejection rises,
As the slanting moon sees whirls of star.
...The sand-leaves are smooth now, the hard stone there smooths;
And the pines of the ancient sanctuary are roofed
And the frescoes are painted with Lords' blood.
Bounded by the early dawn, instinctive as is right,
I challen my brother, ageing at theogony,
To draw near no nearer than a blur of clouds.


A PURE-HEARTED SONG

By my very nature gentle,
My heart's content with books,
I would guide them like a shadow,
Blending image and sound into one
======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================
The white water has run, and the flowers are white.
Soothing a bugle,
Lightening a pot of wine,
The old libidama's cold is stirring again....
Why not come along, then, all of us together, all of us together, all of us together, all of us together, all of us together, all of us together, all of us together, all of us together, all of us together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, here at the White Wolf Mountain,
Drunken for the long road, craven the monkeys are with chickens on wheels
And the Chinese fishermen are brave enough to venture deep in the chilly river
While the Chinese entertain you under the stars of dawn.
...The spell of winter no longer has an end;
In the yellow moss of the river the sheep are still, waiting,
Till their hands on their hearts be wet with cocoa-flavours.
...How gladly will we give back our lives
If we have to go back home with them?


A MOONMAN Biography by Gorgonzon

STories of Symone and Gloria add to my circle of friends.
They are travellers from all walks of life;
Most of them have spent the spring in Paris.
They decide to visit me in the mountains west of the lake.
They find out that their seasick boat is now missing.
They are startled to find out that their new love
Hears death by a thousand flowers, calls home her sick heart.
Some of them even drown in the slanting sun.
I am a comfort to them both, a source of happiness to me for three months
And a comfort to them all night long -- even though they have to turn east for work.


A MESSAGE TO SECRETARY LINGHU

There are faint green mountains and there are deep --
Blue lake, blue river, white cloud --
And a seal of green wood and a thunderbolt in the mid-hanging clouds.
They ask me where I have been on my long journey.
I tell them I have been here a long while.
And they expect me a long-winded reply.
...They ask me where I have been on my journey? --
Anyhow, away from my friends and kin,
Below the clouds, they call me a liar.
They press their chests full with tears into their pram ->ands;
And the one with the pram, the one caring for it,
The one without it, the one with it!


NOT A PARTICIPAN

There are many a night at Loyang Diamond Stream.

I am a stranger to the capital,
More so to the Country of the White God.
 Diamond-Hills are stranger than land to me,
And a long way from town to town I am ashamed to be
And so I am withdrawing from my studies.
...The region is booming with calls for tourists,
And out of the Golden Gate viney sky I can see nothing but a white cloud
Blowing across the eastern sky.


NOTES IN THE YANG GAO

This is a galloping mountain
And a traveller has come too far
To Changan Camp. Sad mountain people!
Red leaves are falling as we whisper.
We bow, we take our tea,
And tell ourselves we have seen the northern hills.
...The region is growing colder,
And the harder border guards creep in,
More tribes are deserting home.
I keep going back, wishing I could go back now
And never reach this desolate region.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lumen makes my heart beat faster
For his lute-violin playing 'Can you hear me, pure heart?
A tenured gong has been roused me,
Bows faster than a bugle,
Topsier than a fist.
...Why don't you and I record the song
On our lute, touching the strings,
Or a more distant song,
Leching together from the lute's strings a foetal cry.


THE TEMPLE OF THE PREMIER OF SHU

Since the Tower of Jade Has Come to an End
There Minwu has been delivering no one but dust;
And the year is cold and the winds are blowing
As he softly asks, "Who is helping me, my friend?
"There have been Ghost Macaws and Ghost Pinees,"
There are ancient Moravian lutes and sobs
And times have not lived the high spirit well....
Heaven is high and earth wide,
And MacGuffins never come down to haunt anyone.



WHEN LU
======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
Rivers and mountains are green even now with the dew of spring
Clouds and dappled mountains are year-round.
...With the Wu country house carried off from town
And its ruins through the River of Heaven,
The town of Huai has been taken in a cloud of slaughter.
...While the State is grieving over the life of Xie
And the State is grieving over the life of Wei,
How many more years shall we have to wait?


PARTING AT A WINE-SHOP IN NANJING

A wind, bringing willow-cotton, sweetens the shop,
And a girl from Wu, pouring wine, urges me to share it
With my comrades of the city whose firmament I so revere.
...I would leave the world, I would go myself,
I would build my boat on the sand,
I would cross the Yellow River alone,
I would dream of built-in companionship.


A POEM TO I XING

I was dreaming of a sister now living alone in a temple,
I was dreaming of an aged old fox whimpering on the grass,
...I passed the fine-wrought pine-trees of the old temple,
I was passing the wood-fired metal stove on my lonely mountain
When I was wondering if it were really needed,
As I passed the ancient stone stove that was so affronted
That only a Grave-Maker was worshipped at Five Flower Stations.
...Oh, at last, when the Buddhist priest Kirtan showed me
How to pay your respect by upholding ancient teaching
You and I young and old are living up our oldages,
How high your ancient fortunes have sunk!


ON THE BORDER

The woods are black and the river closed on it,
Yet two banks per square foot of cloud --
Two that are in this southern city so hated
That fishermen leave their caps and leave their flags,
And three miles of river come down beyond our sight....
There are walls of deer and bear on the water,
And a flat rock face the sun's rays.
If the river were three hundred miles a day,
I would would ride the horse barge that comes from here,
I would dance in the bank of a river-walk,
I would cool my heels in the Imperial Palace stream,
I would breath a bean-pourri before the red-capped Cock-Man.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Everything is quiet here, everywhere is a footprint
And the moonlight steals a dragon-browout,
Where are the late stars casting?


A MAN IN A VINCIANCE

The sky is wide open to sea and river,
And China appears from the water to be six thousand worlds away.
...If only my art might bring me fame
And free my sick old age from office! --
Flower-friends, blossom-trees, reeking of my genius
Came trotting in a cloud of tears,
When would have assuredly told the tale
Of The Dragon Tongan, The Premier of Six Palaces,
Redemption Princess, The Leman Robber
All dressed in maids' robes and silken armour.
Mergers and losses each day slow my heart
And made me idle today.
...I see a white-gold tortoise in the distance.
Oh, to raise my falcon ten thousand shekels --
And a golden-fish ten thousand.


COOLER WEATHER

Her grasses have soft warmed;
And her lone dew is spreading to the branches
And clanging in the evening moon....
Rain dries on her car of hibiscus,
And pines of yellow autumndeft oak
And the morning dew is feverishly going
And day is lost in a world of dew
And night is raining down maple-trees.


A NOTE LEFT FOR AN ABSENT ECLUSE

When I questioned your pupil, under a rose-tree,
"I have to ask you a simple question,"
He said: "If he meets, say, the Marquis d'André,
Do you think he will mention the name of the Marquis de Bulouco?
...I have often been driven into solitude
By days of constant problem and of study.
I am of less use to old age and am less likely
To draw my pupils to new and better understand me.
...I will leave the world and close my door.
I will turn to literature and dance.
I am ashamed to take my talents with me,
But not now but when I have heard so little of you.
...Oh, if even to go back to my old age
Is to be followed by death by the tens
======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================
All night long her seal licks her cheek
And the sweet sound of her iron wine blows my heart to heaven.
...Rain has turned the corner of the Capital;
And pines have shone through the Den of Forth.
She has set the yellow dusk for wildgeese by the northern gate --
And southward she leads her people throughout nights of night
Through dewy reeds and polluting rivers....
Last night a maiden in her sariel was tied to a post
And her broom to a pole by ants crawling through the night.
...People, returning from the night a light rain," grieve when she lights it,
"Will not brush their hair, will they? …Tomorrow they can bury her and sell her off as little as possible;
And tomorrow-come all the gold she wears she'll be selling off
Like a chief-wipe on a silver stake.



A SONG OF FOUR POEMS LATER

Her fingers are cold and her voice is low,
She listens to nothing but the word of the priest,
She has no husband left. What will be left of her?
Her ears feel full with the world;
Her clothes are cold with sweat;
But she gives herself so little thought that she forgets to wash her feet;
When she comes to you, she tells you her true name;
And she suppresses an earful for a few words;
But she forgets to recite it,
And her fingers bleed until she dies
Like a baby lost in a crystal lake.


THE Hanged Man in the Mountain Stream

Where her spirit is disrupted by her illness,
How will she recite the Hanged Man song?
It's a long way to the airport, she thinks,
To read the distant mountains or the river.


A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the meadows of Qingxi Mountain
Are the aldermen wildgeese,
Birds who have come in from the Plains of Red-Wooded Play.
The woods are lean and young,
Not many birds to land,
But people again turning northward on Omei Mountain.
The old crimson-peak is closed to the wilder water.
And we must turn back, must we?
The mountain clouds are twining and tracing the breeze.
...From the stone mansions of Pingyang Palace deep in the twilight,
Lights are drifting like a rain over the city.
...From the imperial jade chamber that bears his heart,
Lights are becoming a mist in China's sunset.
...I woke, and the long road to Yanran
Breathed no wind at all.


A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the meadows of Yu Xin,
The green meadows of Shengzhou
Are hung with autumn dew
And the autumn dew of the river.
Their towers would be bare of the two of them
If there were one Loveable
Behind the Mirror counter-balanced the rising sun.



A SONG OF A CYPOTHERS

On the third day Xi Xin played with his hands
And the palm of his hand was poisoned with yellow froth.
He watched the white trees turn grey
And a river of green cloud hiss,
And a river of cold blood run guttering through the trees.
...When long since whiskered by the wildflowers
He has forgotten what to say to his friends
Sharing wine with secretive men is quieting
The sacred. Drunk on the red wine of the palace-husk,
We share the proud wine of the palace-husk
And the poor drunkenly bid the rich drink it.
...Assyre-gates are closed to the stranger,
With their narrow faces people think they see heaven and earth.
But hear me out-twerking blue and white trees
And close at hand-to-hand battles.
...Both belligerent and warlike signs its escalation
With bell-notes of the river mingled the troops ashore.
...Captured galleys in the darkness are littered with plunder
On the solid rock of the river a thousand fortifiedposts are strewn;
And up the river a thousand flags are borne with a gallant cry;
Captured posts become a place of surrender,
And men like unicorns pledge themselves to the sky
With indestructible banners and crystal spears.


A SONG OF SOBBING BY THE TEMPLE OF THE PREMIER OF SHU

I am the master of the tomb.
...Behind the temple of the master I have kept secret
My tomb for thirty years has been the quiet of the wildgoose,
Deer-catching along the wall.
I suckled as a child water-
======================================== SAMPLE 5 ========================================
By the water's edge were the leaves of three mountain phoenixes,
Three thousand horses at a stretch, under a cloud.
They cross green meadows over hilly trails,
And deep in the dry grasses come the dripping dew
From horses neighing on their curahs, leaving them wet.
...What can I wish you, beyond hoping,
ForTomorrow?...
But I would tender-heartedly address you in the morning
As I have done since my escape from You.



TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. Looking at the moon, I express my thoughts in this poem, which I send to my eldest brother at Fuliang, my seventh brother at Yuqian, My fifteen brother at Wujiang and my younger brothers and sisters at Fuli and Xiagui.

My heritage lost through disorder and famine,
My brothers and sisters flung eastward and westward,
My fields and gardens wrecked by the war,
My own flesh and blood become scum of the street,
I moan to my shadow like a lone-wandering wildgoose,
I am torn from my root like a water-plant in autumn:
I gaze at the moon, and my tears run down
For hearts, in five places, all sick with one wish.



THE INLAID HARP

I wonder why my inlaid harp has fifty strings,
Each with its flower-like fret an interval of youth.
...The sage Chuangzi is day-dreaming, bewitched by butterflies,
The spring-heart of Emperor Wang is crying in a cuckoo,
Mermen weep their pearly tears down a moon-green sea,
Blue fields are breathing their jade to the sun....
And a moment that ought to have lasted for ever
Has come and gone before I knew.



The stars of last night and the wind of last night
Are west of the Painted Chamber and east of Cinnamon Hall.
...Though I have for my body no wings like those of the bright- coloured phoenix,
Yet I feel the harmonious heart-beat of the Sacred Unicorn.
Across the spring-wine, while it warms me, I prompt you how to bet
Where, group by group, we are throwing dice in the light of a crimson lamp;
Till the rolling of a drum, alas, calls me to my duties
And I mount my horse and ride away, like a water-plant cut adrift.



THE PALACE OF THE SUI EMPEROR

His Palace of Purple Spring has been taken by mist and cloud,
As he would have taken all Yangzhou to be his private domain
But for the seal of imperial jade being seized by the first Tang Emperor,
He would have bounded with his silken sails the limits of the world.
Fire-flies are gone now, have left the weathered grasses,
But still among the weeping-willows crows perch at twilight.
...If he meets, there underground, the Later Chen Emperor,
Do you think that they will mention a Song of Courtyard Flowers?



TO ONE UNNAMED I

You said you would come, but you did not, and you left me with no other trace
Than the moonlight on your tower at the fifth-watch bell.
I cry for you forever gone, I cannot waken yet,
I try to read your hurried note, I find the ink too pale.
...Blue burns your candle in its kingfisher-feather lantern
And a sweet breath steals from your hibiscus-broidered curtain.
But far beyond my reach is the Enchanted Mountain,
And you are on the other side, ten thousand peaks away.



TO ONE UNNAMED II

A misty rain comes blowing with a wind from the east,
And wheels faintly thunder beyond Hibiscus Pool.
...Round the golden-toad lock, incense is creeping;
The jade tiger tells, on its cord, of water being drawn
A great lady once, from behind a screen, favoured a poor youth;
A fairy queen brought a bridal mat once for the ease of a prince and then vanished.
...Must human hearts blossom in spring, like all other flowers?
And of even this bright flame of love, shall there be only ashes?



IN THE CAMP OF THE SKETCHING BRUSH

Monkeys and birds are still alert for your orders
And winds and clouds eager to shield your fortress.
...You were master of the brush, and a sagacious ruler
======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
Somewhere down the line of Yu Xin's palace, a secret source of joyous flowery-ways opens,
Lifting from the shadows a crown of blue jade,
Like a long shadow cloak the emperor left behind him.
...At twilight he left his jade-white horse and rode away,
Leaving his holy temple behind him.


ON HEARING JUN THE BUDDHIST MONK
FROM SHU PLAY HIS LUTE

The monk from Shu with his green silk lute-case,
Walking west down Omei Mountain,
Has brought me by one touch of the strings
The breath of pines in a thousand valleys.
I hear him in the dusk of the capital's great river;
I hear him in the morning bell to the far sky.
...The sand below the villages town line
Is a place of pilgrimage for those who are sick,
And rain has deepened the chrysanthemums.
I have often taken to heart Buddhist songs
And am glad to be a monk in Youzhou.



ON HEARING A BUDDHIST MONK
FROM SHU PLAY HIS LUTE

There are sobs when we hear the voice of a god
That I fear the washing-machine will not fill
All my tears for water yet come back.
...The mountains and the river are two hundred miles
Overlocked by the mountain and the river;
How shall we long to be two thousand miles,
Call me by my hairpants?



THE CAMP OF THE YANGZI

The stars and the River of Heaven come alive
In the water's clear void of snow...
If only my hobby were as carpetsong
And the Emperor would visit us in the campfire.



A BUDDHIST WOMAN

On a green grassy field beyond Shuafang
You have spent your childhood here, a stranger,
Where sheep and goats graze in the same mound.
Your high gate is curving like a river's,
With wheat and barley transported by it.
No one comes here who is not a follower of the priest,
He who has seen the heavenly net,
He who has prayed in the night-plant respects it.
We womange to go back home, to share the premium.



ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
Watching it alone from the window of her chamber-
For our boy and girl, poor little babes,
Are too young to know where the capital is.
Her cloudy hair is sweet with mist,
Her jade-white shoulder is cold in the moon.
...When shall we lie again, with no more tears,
Watching this bright light on our screen?


A SPRING VIEW

Though a country be sundered, hills and rivers endure;
And spring comes green again to trees and grasses
Where petals have been shed like tears
And lonely birds have sung their grief.
...After the war-fires of three months,
One message from home is worth a ton of gold.
...I stroke my white hair. It has grown too thin
To hold the hairpins any more.


A NIGHT-VIGIL IN THE LEFT COURT OF THE PALACE

Flowers are shadowed, the palace darkens,
Birds twitter by to and fro, where first the Emperor would visit;
He places fragrant jade pendants at his belt;
He halves pinepods in his palace ladder to the purple chambers;
And, union-spirit, hurry to bed,
All night in the palace the rushing shall leave me.
...My torches are short now, and my lantern is hot.
I climb to the top. I count the stars and then Minaret.
I is sitting there for no other person than the pure moon....
Journeying is hard,
Journeying is hard.
 must is thick with drag
That everything is beside-can-be-done.
Dancing still requires holding your breath
And being aloof from everything.
The more you dance the harder you can be dancing;
You are destroying beauty with your slow motion.
Start with your knees. Try to hold your face down.
...After a while I forget what I was saying.
You are so fixed in yourself
That everything you see is real,
There is nothing beyond you but the pure moon.
...Sunset lingers in the evening trees,
Nothing to see for four walls of water.
...I am no nearer to the Queen of Chu than you;
Yet I know you cannot leave the western city.
...Waiting for the Liaoyang Prefect to summon me,
I think of you
======================================== SAMPLE 7 ========================================
A BITTER LOVE BITTERMOTIC

The candles
Are kept at dusk in the quiet corner of the old inn
While my little fairy-love, dancing,
For years, has been providing wine and cheer
To keep the candles going all night long.


THE EIGHTS A STREAM

Like a heavy cloud drifting
In a sudden wind of glory,
I am passing, between cloud and desert,
Three countries. The country ahead is courteous;
The way leads slowly into Asia.
...At the northern border towns activity is high;
The number of white hairs elevated
To a deep pinecone.


MOUNTAIN-STONES

Rough were the mountain-stones, and the path very narrow;
And when I reached the western peak I found them littered with boulders;
And when I reached the southern border I found them littered with boulders....
The wide plain extending both ways,
While the night kept flying and the mountains shook.


MOUNTAIN-LODGES

A thousand wild-goose-quakes is the sign of a wildgoose;
In the flood-plain after the war, when the abundant water
Goes mounded over a desolate battlefield;
In the warm pines of a southern lake --
All that is needed now is a shout for its friends.


LODGE-LODGES

A thousand fire-quakes is the sign of a wildfire;
In the flood-plum of a southern lake --
Wildgeese are flying homeward over mounds and hills,
With the exception of a twig and a torn cord.


PARTING I

With the year gone, and the mountains both swollen and furrowed;
And the first snow-birds in a long wind,
The people of Morsel Gate are pouring over pavilions --
The palace-gate is unlivable without them....
Though a mountain-state be dangerous, never becapithered to a tower.


Parting II

Though a country be as noble as yours is as free as the stars,
You are the same as bleak a moonlight.
You suppress beauty, you shield it with prosperity.
You keep the same customs as before,
Yet still you eat the same fish and drink the same drinks.


THE BEAUTIFUL XI SHI

Since beauty is honoured all over the capital,
How could you not be attracted?
...Night has reachen its calm on the pale sun,
And the Tartar chieftain can see the waves at sea.



A SONG OF SOBBING BY THE RIVER

I am only an old stranger; I listen. --
You whisper to me that I should be as bright as you;
Or you whisper something along the lines
And I hear you talk, and I doubt my own voice for long.


ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
THINKING OF MY BROTHERS IN SHANDONG

All alone in a foreign land,
I am twice as homesick on this day
When brothers guide their younger sisters;
And our hearts are in the hand of the vengeful
And we weep till our tears are spent.


HOW THE Mormons LOST THE YEAR'S AGO

In the pot's flame still there was only water;
He heard women in the darkness lament;
And he saw a wilderness of birds and fish stolen
And devoured by the spring-dragon.


MOUNTAIN SNOW

A misty rain comes blowing with a wind from heaven,
And a snow in the fjord
Where little men lie for the night;
And his ears feel frostbites !


A SONG OF THE SOUTHERN RIVER

Under the branches of the northern river there come from flying insects
And spring-glories in his window-panes.


THE OLD AND NEW HARMONIZING

Where heaven's face is filled with overflowing arecups,
Where mango-birds have stolen the willows from their perches,
Where a bugle breaks the crystal wind
How everywhere in the temple the names of the Lords of the Realm
BeYed for all to see....


THE HAN MONUMENT

In the purity of your holy temple,
You have erected the first blood-red marble
And the temple-maid's robes are flowing like snow.
You have invited the living to join you,
While hundreds of bats are at the same time
Watching you drift away, like a sudden rain,
And no sound can come to your moon-drifts of slanting sunshine.


A MESSAGE TO CEN

I am lying in a chair in the edict-seat of your great wisdom,

======================================== SAMPLE 8 ========================================
The bright moon was stirring the river,
And a warm wind brushing the sand
Breathes bliss in its chariot races.
...At midnight, when the heavy clouds have lifted their spirits,
A.F.A. marksmen watch the plains from three hills,
And when they are near, they throw down their weapons.
...China age: a vivid description
Of the heroic years, with their five-coloured titles,
Appear in the printed accounts in order of appearance.
The late Emperor had his own copy, each year's guest,
Of military successes and failures, written in ancient script.
The Chinese troops were level-headed, and could not hold a wicker basket,
They were therefore slow to retaliate, growing impatient
And would-be liberators, cutting deals not yet noticed.
...Do you imperial commissioners
Mean to be less kind than bandits?
The Empire is small when it comes to horses and men,
But you have the nerve to go against the wind and sail!
...Decay and decline are three things.
That you manage to salvage what you have lost,
And that you sacrifice your life to save the very thing you love.
But how can you sacrifice it so that it is given back?
...We remember a poor old woman, with a wound in her ear,
In a lane excessively narrow to assist in the sweeping away of rivers;
Her lane was so narrow that the rushing of a car could not be a problem.
...While she worked her temporary lane, it was shut off to the dogs;
And when she went back empty handed, no one would listen to her.
...Had she known that playing by a third fiddle was a sin,
She might have taken to playing more modestly.
...But, having had some of the favour, she has taken to singing its mandarinarin-ducks.
Her small lane was refused a hearing --
Which was against the grain of northern marriage
But which was accepted by the official, and what remained was her chance.
...She took to heart the melody and sang it cool and mellow,
Playing the lute, the flute, the harpsichord, several time.
And then the bank was cleared of the cold water, and she stood closer to the people
And kept to her lute and the country-quilt, and her counting-cups more and more were brought to her
And more and more were crying in the street than were enjoying themselves
This was granted to her by her great-grandfather, a duke of Xin,
And given to all the girls of the Yangzhou district
While her mother, at the palace-gate, was tending the sickly farm-hoople.
...While a girl seconding this song was likewise given,
Her father, forwarding it among palace servants,
Gave it to his favourite disciple,
Then a fellow pupil of his handed it to his brother at the palace-gate,
And, later, gifted all around the house
And took it sometimes to and fro with a dance of his own,
Where girls, one by one, called upon him to bring them,
And bring them to their parents and express them in writing.

Girls, one by one, called and told his name,
And their names were recorded by his many miracles.
And then one day a grandaddy came by to talk to them,
Whose talk, with deep thought, was as calm as the river
As if spoken by the characters in the script.
The first to talk, the quiet the second to talk
And the third to moan, the two saying nothing,
As if spoken by the characters in the script.

...Though the characters be different, and the words different,
The general tries his best to read them,
Telling them sad words of Chinese,
But only grimaces and mock-eries make his heart beat for long;
And soon all the while the sadness is passing
Around the throne in a row....
There are people in the Cloud City palace with no others --
But people of great willow-caves, remembering those days of Ye.
They had heard that good willows are broken first in China,
And tried to restore it last in America,
But were crushed to the ground and could not find a way out.
...At the same moment a great wind of demon-dust over the river
And of stone bloweth at the Jade Pass war-fields,
Into a place of great destruction, of great destruction.
The people, saddened and unable to repel the blow,
Bring an army to hold them off,
Military artists classed among the noble houses.
...Build a wall between us and the waters of the bay,
And wait for the foreign songs of the flute to finish.
======================================== SAMPLE 9 ========================================
There's no other way to put it.
Since there are two worlds:
One free and another without,
All the way to heaven, before my eye,
I summon you again from my deep sleep.
...How beautiful that madam
Where willowscreens for the hundred flowers she has redeemed.



THINKING OF A PARTNER

Drive the breezes up a flight of trees
To one with the mountain, for they warm my heart
And open myory day and night.
...With partings still on the tongue of the boughs an indication of wine...
Alas, my friend, there's no one nearby!
O my lamp of the old Empire,
How can I bear to you the burden of tribute?


ON HEARING AN WANSHAN PLAY THE REED-PIPE

Bamboo from the southern hills was used to make this pipe.
And its colour. had the cold of night;
The colour of its walls changed;
But the artist, after finding a cheap and rapid medium,
Made it a habit to use;
Of which I learn that good artists learn the hard way.
...I, a pupil, would like to be an expert in this art,
Of which I am less fortunate.
I am better known, more reverential of nature;
And less likely to encounter anyone amiss.
...I like better the style of Emperor Wu:
His robes are lovelier and wider,
His carpets are lovelier and wider;
His flowers are as though they could be seen,
And his mirrors are far colder and darker
And colder and darker for ever and ever with which to see his face.
...His bronze palace, his gold palace, are just at home,
They all have their places of porcelain, each with its own mirror.
But since wine is taken from heaven and made wine-broker,
Let each case be assigned its own judge.


CHANGING IN THE BORDER WINTHROW

As I walk in the new spring, white with creation,
Toward my cottage that was built on stolen pasture,
I find the flower-bed splayed out front,
But a curve in the moonlight shows the autumn moon.
...A green crane arrives with his music;
And I know what to expect in the evening.


A MOONLIGHT NIGHT Ebb and flow
When the moon is low and the stars long,
And the waves are not in a while way,
I am not at home, but awake and thinking.
...Ledges of cloud in the midnight breeze
Scroll down for my driftcloud.com
Date drawn from freshets from last night.
Clouds are blowing toward the south
And the high ridge at Yellow River sleepy.
My left breast may well be bigger,
But my right temple-bell--
How can I bear to my bed my grief?
...When the moonlight has pared my white eyebrows,
I can read the message in the night's candle.
...Blue fields have been cleared of the old woods
And green vines have grown round my wet grass
In a straight line to the horizon.


NOT FINDING QIU YI

My hair had hardly covered my forehead.
I was painting in the sand,
When a wind from the north
Breathes change color enough to hide
And sunlight fogs through the dirt;
And so I turn and see the square
In front of a people's temple,
Where children grieve for the departed --
That mountain girl, in a dream,
Carrys a basket of winecups for her to share
And dreams come again in the morning
Where her teacher brings her home and discusses them
And evening the stars drift in the sea,
And the tears run down my cheek
And I am going to bed early --
But my husband is awake and hates wind and rain.
...Knowledge is power, not fortune.
Bred to be the only man in the village,
He knew the rich and famous were scammers.
By the moon that rose on the River of Heaven,
He knew the poor and unheard were scammers.
...In the trees that swallow the stately Qiao house,
His shadow has entered the hollowed-out house
Out is his shadow in the grassy path --
Birds are grazing on his fields,
His fields have been idle for three nights.
...He has to send his envoy to China
Where his wealth can buy his quick wit.
Steward of the white grove, he really is!
Araping his silver horse, he never fails to praise it
And tosses it high for completeness's sake.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME FROM
======================================== SAMPLE 10 ========================================
It's a long way home, a long way of my heart...
When shall I reach my hiding-place and be able to face them all?
...Sisted, I lie,
Sleeping-Dragon,
Sleeping-Horse,
Sleeping-Pointer,
Sleeping-Mark,
Playing-Mark, Song-Of-Snow.



My heart in my foot, reading, writing,
An empty cany outside my door
My eyes round a dying forest,
My ears perch close to a rolling white sunset
And a ruined fort below
That never a Dou Liang official was sent.
...The Liaoyang becomes a people's war
And China degenerates into a people- band.
...The fate of the Poor Town
Hears a sigh from the far-off
When prices increase for metal from the scrap metal of the Wheel of Fortune.
...Soldiers of the Day God take our wives and make us wives of drunks
Prepare us for anything going to the sky.
Though we seem to be making little impression,
We are honored guests in the south.
...Attired for battle, China cooks rice to please the God-fearing
And the cavalry brings our swords through the wind.
...China is a people-chang counsellor
With brows down low and a mind of his own,
So Chang is the teacher of ten thousand songs.
...a coven of monkeys is meeting in the night
To shake and scream and crawl and hex &c.
...our flags and banners pale in the end
Of days of peace when no one but the conquerors
And the banners and horses of the Horse and Wolf both were effaced.
...The days come that call Pepper-O-Pot clear of dreidel blood
And wine goes bad with the dancers-with her thin silk robe.
But remember, Lady, that no one can really save you,
So go and read a long newspaper as we tell our last,
 old story.


We parted, at age of fifty-two, in a wind of friendship
And ocean of tears following our red hands,
Twenty years apart, without one artist living.
...We met, a year later, at the towne of Wu....
You were raised as a child of the forest,
With chrysanthemums to entertain your white chair
And wildgeese to keep an eye on your eastern window.
By the lantern of the palaceside wine was blown and sound was lost,
And the musicians stopped to play and others stopped to play.
And so we dance the old Robespierre-Lucy net and rock and roll and....
Alive, well, ever-young, healthy now,
The old comrade, forgotten and penniless,
Lords of the capital, discontent and insolent,
Who stooped low and looked everywhere,
His penniless companion, raising his lute again,
Leaves a mess of red silk in the five Imperial Palace.
...Our red-haired friend, our white-headed neighbour,
Howls into the ten rooms of Heaven to await news
That his friend from college in Cambridge was killed in action.
...We chat, like our aged friend from Cambridge,
And suppose events to take turns at the Eastern Shorecoing
Berthed a month a year, and then as in heaven only,
And ask how the astronomers at the Western and Southern Bayszurelivermationswork.
...The tables are cleared for a new and better year,
And glad families welcome one another with open arms.
...summer long after the spring chill has run my old river;
Newspapers are called to the Yan in the closing rain;
Rail-riders are blowing in the evening rain
To and fro at will along the waterfront.
...call it flutistory-moot, or flutistory-ranger,
Because of its happy trees and its fluted-silk bridge --
That, throughout history, the chief moral-engineers have concentrated
The burden of government on a people with few forms of entertainment.
...The State is a great woman-gatherers
And its officers, with tendencies of THE SOUTH GOVERNMENT,
In a wise and just country, to prop itself on natural resources
Fills its forests and oceans with man-made cloud;
But in a just and just empire, it poisons
And resents the massive use of capital.
...The yellowing of trees is an old cause;
And people, in fear of heights, move in the dust!
...I tread on a lute in the palace of hall-omitted comfort.
The dense cloud of a vast city grows awkward at the same moment.
And the autumn weather is unreliable, Parliament
======================================== SAMPLE 11 ========================================
The world has forgotten the true fountain of this teaching
And people endlessly ask what can be learned
From a simple glance.
The red and white North Star at dawn
On a distance of clouds and mountains the two towns
Are now, just north of the border, the villages of Wu and Xue.
And then, holding blue birds in their talons,
Take up in your lips the Huai and the Junflower,
And, holding green crescent-fires in your souls,
Look toward the northeast at all nights
And be careful of dreams; for they come to you like a tempest in a sable....
The North Star, the Golden Calf, is raising its lone sun
In a great attack on Rome, and the Emperor fearful,
He sends delegations to Barbar and Kazan districts;
And the Emperor is minded to crush the sect!



A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the Temple of the Great Premier stands an ancient cypress
With an earth of cloud and a bark of rock....
The girth of its white bark would be the reach of forty men
And its tip of kingfish-blue is two thousand feet in heaven.
Dating from the days of a great ruler's great statesman,
Their very tree is loved now and honoured by the people.
Clouds are blowing for sunshine today after a long night's rain;
And the river running northward is roaring with people.
...The Emperor Xuanlyie was fond of pointing out crevasses
And many calendrates of gold and silver were strewn about the plain.
...Whence writers who have written deceptively grim deceptions
And phrenixes clad in dragon- feathers
Are persecuted in the yellow and gold sections.
But better writers can bring the cold facts
And deceptive phrases meaning the same things.
...Of ancient cycads traversing the sky,
One like Yan is suggesting a new channel for the world,
Another like Yingling is attempting a old one,
Yet another like Yingling-kicks the drums for his old friend's death.
Where is the Emperor right now? --
He seems to be floating in the sand, upside-down,
On a calm autumn morning.


A SPRING FAVOR

With spring-cool ends of the leaves of a southern blueflower
Running slowly as my left hand,
I am praising you as one praises a great master.
Though a spirit has no place in a north sky palace,
You have surpassed intellect and courage.
And so I am praising you with a blessing even greater.
In the firmament of the Gorges of ancient chrysanthemums,
And in the Stone of Bronze the title of "Great" has now become "Greater."
In the Nine Granaries of the Sun you have surpassed me even as in the Martial Temple,
I have surpassed the Phoenix Gods and the Skrulls.
You have surpassed the Emperor Taizongcik....
And I am almost as proud at the sight of my name on a spear.
Though a spirit has no place in a north sky palace,
You have surpassed intellect and courage.
And so I take my bows and march as soon as I see you,
Dry my eyes and parrot my story.
Though a spirit has no place in a north sky palace,
You have surpassed intellect and courage.
Cause and effect I have sailed and feathered my sail,
Scouts' feathers my brow and my cheek;
And, with the help of a dream,
An ancient drum and a soundbite vow my life of dragon assort
To the Crane Terrace.
Though a spirit has no place in a north sky palace,
You have surpassed intellect and courage.
Cause and effect I have sailed and feathered my sail,
Scouts' feathers my brow and my cheek;
And, with the help of a dream,
An ancient drum and a soundbite vow my life of dragon assort
To the Crane Terrace.
Though a spirit has no place in a north sky palace,
You have surpassed intellect and courage.

To the Crane Terrace.


A SONG OF A PRINCE DEED

Beside the Temple of the Great Red Flower,
The pine-trees of Sung Mountain offer a screen upon which a dream
Is recorded. . .The Twin Forces Come Running
The zigzags gave birth to four sons;
The Dragon Princess nurtured his efforts;
And the martial artist honed his art
With a dream that lasted an evening
======================================== SAMPLE 12 ========================================
I moved here in spring from my mother's own garden,
And have lived here among the green hills and woods
For three years in spite of the cold.
There are two banks, one at the southern end,
The other along the river at the North Star.
Both banks are bare except for a bare dirt infield.
At midnight, when the cold makes the ground lightly wet,
I lie down to sleep in the twinkling of an eye.
On the bank, surrounded by green and white string,
I watch birds chirping, as if they had been given the chance
To breed and to fly their perch with as few as were chosen.
And so, when I have looked back from my own river
Room has been given to write a better book.


TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
ON AN AUTUMN TRIP TO SHU

My heart has been heavy all day long
Because you have so nobly served mankind;
But, with a grain of sand in the teeth,
You also careened through the clouds toward Shu,
With no one to console you but your children.
When the rider's yellowing wings darken with rain
And the rider doesn't seem to be breathing,
The students who finished second fail to show;
The gold-plated door is unsealed, its hinges broken,
And the bronze-walled chandelier, the curtain of death,
Its pure light the pallor of night....
But I still remember the late Emperor Wu,
With his eight-cornered body protected by his own silk,
Serving in number at the northern palace,
Whose prestige transcends the earth.
...With his green hair long since wakened, his polished armour now ready,
The two of us walk together on our round horse-horses,
Dare scientists look at the far sky and think of home,
Confucius brings us teacups and wines from the palace-wardens.
We talk, we laugh, we chuse to our guests as we three
Drive by the imperial grave on our wide moonshine:
The sky is wide open to us, deep in my heart
This second journey, this second journey, this this, this, this, this, these are all needed
For me to the capital of Hong Kong Chinese culture
And now to the Forbidden City. It's over, it's done, it goes again.
...I climb to the top. I see the three Kingdoms entering –
And then the eastern gate is unsealed and a snow-peak cut open.
I see the capital's nine-flowered towers rise, bringing life
To a rainbow of colours, all the way to the heavens.
...I lift my lantern and see a multitude of people and be
Till autumn ends and nothing but black and white clouds await me.



OVER THE BORDER

The jade-white cliffs of Yanran are coloured with flowers;
The crescent-shaped river is open to pilgrims;
The three Lake Dongting will host visiting lords;
The triplet of Wu who are growing old,
And of old Wu, sick, and not yet in Wu,
To move beyond Yanran's walls any more.
...I move out of the imperial footprint on a 24-mileable trail
And consider a city-plant along the river's edge.
Cycles of its height, like the turns in the moon,
Where spring moves beyond the city, like the wind in the north....
I will turn back home, I will say no more,
I will throw my scattered flowers back home,
I will go back to my pavilion to read The Green Void.



A TRIP TO ZHONGNAN

Have you not heard of Zhongnan Mountain, this divine source,
That has moved miles and miles to bring you the words of my prayer?
Its lonely mountain-ice grows pale, its crystal moon dim,
Just as a wildgoose should gaze upon it
And its white peak dims its southward course.
...My heart and my dreams are in this building,
And I dream of a pine-cone-trees rededI can barely cover my head.
I have come three thousand miles away. The sound of my heart and my dreams
Is drifting off into the far, far ocean....
I have stopped short of killing, I have stopped short of swallowing,
Of a city-goorred wildgoose on a string, of a people living alone in a mountain river,
Over the border in the desolate valley of the river.



A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed vermilion steps,
To be parted by
======================================== SAMPLE 13 ========================================
On a yellow spring morning,
You have had enough of me.
I am a partaker among flowers;
You a parterer among mansions.
Let me fling down my official seal,
I might be a partier in a palace where all else was at stake.
...No more bottle-hands, no more chemists,
Just me and my bottle-hand going in and out.
Shall goodwill ever be secure?
On the evening of ten o'clock this autumn,
I stroke a few incense-wicks as LIttle JONBEATheELGE
AT HIS BUDDHIST PRIEST PALACE

In the candlelight he sees a monk
Dip among themselves news of the spring.
The body of a long- ago god-fought Empire
Is cooled by warm water in a warm lake.
The breath of earth and water is slow at first,
Then horses show signs of drying up...
When a monk from Wu is assigned togo
High office, the name of it is very much known
And there come to him men of high rank:
...The scholar Liu Yuyang

With long brunches looks at his distant advisor.
He has a black hair whip in his hand --
And a beardless child of Chinese wonder when the bushel cabbage arrives
And a porcelain- statue of Wu weep after him day and night.
...From the enchanted palace-gate, deep in the palace-villages,
Girls and young men of genius are gathering
For the first time in thousands of years, under one roof.
The clouds have opened in the river valley into valleys of blue water,
And Nanjing's sand dunes are green and well maintained.
...While in government, a man's heart is tenable
And his barefoot frame of armour is an inspired symbol of glory.
But since not all writers are created equal,
And minds are varyable through study,
Here at the Western and Southern Palaces approve,
And wives of officials feel the strain of it all.
...I petition the Emperor on my great minister's successful
Break in the earth; I cry for him in my hall;
I am the peacemaker standing before the red Sun.



MEMORIES IN EARLY WINTER

Drink, my guest, while we cross the autumn water!-
The icy water is rising and the snow is falling,
And our solitary boat, that has no player on it,
Bears little comfort as we head for the surface.
...Mist veils the cold water and makes the waves sevensomethings;
And then, slowly turning the ice, we find joy in watching nature --
A white deer, speaking in a foreign land,
Tears down a long drawn-out river;
A porcupine still has its head in the air,
And a coral-beard, quiet and content,
On their sweet spring days there are more than meets the eye.
...With our sail gone, are our thoughts lost,
As we think of the long gone reef.



A SONG OF A GIRL

There's a girl here who looks a little younger
But is hardly different from the others.
...She seems to be dancing still, hoping for rain.
Her hair was painted beautiful last night --
And her pearly shell is smiling now on the sand.
Her bright smile is breaking every quiet girl away....
There are stranger islands and landmines in the whirl of her sudden glance,
While a pure heart strives for word and deed.
...How sorry and happy a girl must be,
As she sits here and smiles, watching the tears run my way....
When shall she come forward and join us,
Where tears and tears are no cause to weep but sonorous fanning
All her tears spent on her screen of tears?


THE JADE DRESSING-TABLE

Last night my girdle came undone,
And this morning a luck-beetle flew over my bed.
To find the student from School Day on her formal bundle was a joy.
So we uppercast-clads pack our things, we horse up the horse,
And we take off our official robes to show the world --
In the morning we pull out our jade-blue drum and our comrade's spear,
We sing along to each other as we watch the flush of flags,
While girls and young women in our midst frolic and laugh.
We hear that the Jade Dragon Bamboo Stroll has ended,
And news of the world and of ladies comes to us,
As we dust off our official robes and welcome them with open mouth,
We chat for hours with our pranks and vain thoughts
Till news of the Jade Dragon Bamboo Holiday
Began
======================================== SAMPLE 14 ========================================
Why not take a look through my master's
Calm eye?



ON A WALK IN THE EARLY SPRING
TO A FRIEND IN A RIVER-ENDULMENT

Are you craving a bit of home, stranger?
Heaven is cold and windy here,
And nowhere is warfare as I see
On the border where my wars are fought
And China grows restless and my friends sick.
...Who here understands country well?
I leave town, I go home. What am I waiting for,
Where idle threat of the sun?


A NIGHT-MOORING NEAR SFO COURT

Far off in the clouds stand those red chambers
With frost on the grasses creeping up,
And far in the court of the King palace, princes and queens sit swaying;
And far in the room of the late Emperor Taizong
The cold tone of a guest burdening him with oaths;
Till the King's footman, at his ease,
Told him the chamber was very small --
But high spirits were in the evening, would-be guests
And the Emperor rewarded them with grand speeches.
...Whence, then, great statesmen are they?
I ask myself.
The very state it is in is asked
Whether it be because of its height, because of its colour,
Or because of its great Emperor, known for his eloquence....
He is sometimes trimming grasses with his hands and flowers are withering away
Till his nine Great Policies come into being, with no Emperor as great as they are-
And, for the Houses of Zhuang realm, at last hearing of a new Emperor
They abolished official distinction -- abolished all taxes.
They established in the earth of the river an empire --
Not one of the original eight PRCs could rival
The power of the Yang government, rivaling the of the sun.
...Must man's constant meditation on the past ever comfort him?
He is inclined more to memories than to words.
And he is constantly distressed when eventsional matters
Entering remembered memories, ashamed of those he knew.
...I tapering off my diet, breaking the bank,
I take up again no book at all.
Like grasses that were once his strength,
They are tipped with dust with age.
He who has not thought well of appearance,
Is slow to see in his distant houses.
... I will sing, I will push, I will tug, and he will move!



ON HEARING DONG PLAY THE FLAGEOLET
A POEM TO PALACE-ATTENDANT FANG

When this melody for the flageolet was made by Lady Cai,
When long ago one by one she sang its eighteen stanzas,
Even the Tartars were shedding tears into the border grasses,
And the envoy of China was heart-broken, turning back home with his escort.
...Cold fires now of old battles are grey on ancient forts,
And the wilderness is shadowed with white new-flying snow.
...When the player first brushes the Shang string and the Jue and then the Yu,
Autumn-leaves in all four quarters are shaken
With a murmur of "Peach-trees, blow my mind for a half an autumn!
Why not come along, then, every morning and evening,
To ouricheages and feasts in turn?"



ON HEARING DONG PLAY THE FLAGEOLET

A POEM TO PALACE-ATTENDANT FANG

When she danced the dagger pointing westward
And opened her chamber to the wind that was channelling love,
This song of the Fairy-Prince, which had been playing the night of the Dagger,
Leaves her aching breast and fixes her cheek-bone....
She tells him her jade-white face and the Dagger she had stolen from the wrong-man;
He darkens again and ponders a moment,
He ponders again a second time.



He heard barbarian gong in the distant dusk
And wildgeese, flying southward, pounding on our tents,
And girl in the midwinter palace, dreaming of her master,
How powerless are the rulers of this world!
...Who knows if the Well-Tempered receive the Eternal Purple?
We hear that the Jade-Fleet has vanished,
That Generals Shang for onei years have not returned;
And a Fourth-Hand tentatively invites the Emperor's ambassadors
To the Yellow Palace in pomp and circumstance.



His eyes gaze wandered once to the Court of Liang
And place of fifteen stone towers clustered near one another
And to the River God's Stone for a cause of sacred monument.
The Martial Judge's heart was swift with the motion
======================================== SAMPLE 15 ========================================
The moon was rising slowly,
And a long wind lightly on her shuffle
Moved that no one know her,
She pushed aside everything she held dear
And opened her bosom wide and held her pear with one stroke.
...Then when she had closed behind her by the bed of her clothes
And was closing her door to the street-hermit's mat,
No one knew where she was, or why she was still.
Her sad hair had become a dagger to their hearts;
But some of them still would ask me where I had been.
...She would move her bugles and her sweet-smelling flowers
And arrange them on her wall like patterns,
And arrange them on her bed, in the season of spring,
And show them to whoever answered,
Where she went the evil spirit sent her.
...Though she stood so far behind her, she would come back
If she had enough will power? -
Whatever will be left for the ark over the river,
There is nothing left but hoof to scratch.


A MEETING WITH MYERS AND BRUN WHENCE
FAREWELL

There was a girl, called Gray-Sheep,
Who was troubled and unhappy all night,
When her father, a seafaring merchant,
Bred in the morning to freshen his house,
Was drowned in the overcast sky.
...The brook was bubbling, a mark of spring
Was drifting down like the River of Stars.
The spring-wind was a little pink,
Like a cuckoo's nest in a white riverbank,
And the spring-rain
Were pouring down like a rain in a misty palace.
...When she was little, your father was a seafaring
General, and very jealous of wine
His people fleeing with them,
From the wildgeese into the green mountains of Moray.
...Do you mean that your army
Captured the great General, and broke the Town of Green-Beak?
...The River of Yellow Flowers
Was marching its own volleying,
Not daring to cross the water.


A LONG CLIMB

Where a river that winds through heaven,
A cloud that flies its thousand shadowy shadows;
Seven times in a day the moon rises for the day;
And the Tower of Jade Powers
Is a thousand peaks and valleys, all of one lodge,
With the morning mist blowing across the cold scale of mountains.
...Where the sun has entered the whitets and the crescent,
The Kingdom of Heaven is at peace,
There are no more vipers and the white-blossoming Leopard-Mountains-
Can you guess why I have been blowing lies so far
Around the Country Hall this evening? --
Cause me no inconvenience this evening, my white-bristled aipemi
Breathes its fragrance in its golden vase after dawn.



HARD ROADS IN SHU

Oh, but it is high and very dangerous!
Such travelling is harder than scaling the blue sky.
...Until lately I have been most troubled
By your kind directions and your sorry songs.
I am passing sometimes pines which were stolen from you
And were, some years ago,
Raped to the sky's breaking point.
...Turning, then, from one troubled habit
To a perilous journey
Of one sick with wine and hungry with fowl,
I have been longing for a change
Over the water's edge and of my lane.



THE TEMPLE OF THE PREMIER OF SHU

Though it took ages to grow at the Temple of the Preceptor
Now at the eastern wall of the Capital spring is colouring more like a mirror
And the waves of Qunari aiding the Emperor
And the mango-birds of Jiangwork launching from the sea
And the camel-riding Kiowa dances in the deep mountain night
And the breath of the wildgoose tries to join the others.

...The savage Xie I know, with misgiving,
Can carve in heaven images only the living.
But, building on the greatest of noble pastimes,
Heaven gave him a son to name after --
That never met the parental will.
...The Tang clan was much in the habit of granting him gifts
And to give him cod-boats and other valuables,
But until the year 2012 started out of country,
This introduced and encouraged the very first matron
And made him, first-rate, even at his age.
...The matron's son, a boy of fifteen,
Was sent to study at the eastern camp,
With his mother's breast uncovered, watching him for the first time.
And then came the loom: "Master, do you know that midnight?
It is ten
======================================== SAMPLE 16 ========================================
The Golden Gate Bridge, in the sunset, divides the city
Before the three Lake districts: at a railway station
A light wind is blowing across a desolate stretch
And the train veers for its journey, before any people.
This corner of the world is a desolate land
And people, away from the city, fleeing for their lives.
...But here on the southern border, day-glories flood a river
And chill the sky with a pinescone.



Against the Pale Blue Wall

Blind to see the white cloud floor,
On the northern border lies the Faith-Beacon.

To the southward lies Lucifer's dearest dream.
In the night breathless moon, he watches the River of Heaven rise.
He knows how to trick the Bringer;
Yet he is firm and firm-hearted- never doubting.
...Let never a dove cry in the darkness
For help from a Bringer of Jade!


A SONG OF FAIR WOMEN IN A CAMPBEAR

There are sobs when evil thoughts reach the heart.
They follow dreams; they enter into the cupboards.
They are as floating candles in summer.
So fair was their play and so sincere was their thought
That doubt was not based on a dream....
But since doubt is a part of life,
Let us refrain from rash ideas.
A CICADA

Time is smoke and dust in this desert,
In a foreign land where feverish appetites
And frivolous wine is in vain.
...Oh, let an aged and decrepit maiden
Eat porridge and laugh on the red bank!
Let her embroidery be ornamented with banners
And plump as a mushroom, and decked with unicorns!
Let her maidservant wear flowery skirts to her lord's wedding
And warmly greet him at the Yuyang Palace gate.
...Attendant of the court, she has no cap;
She is casting off from court-gate gossip
And sits idly by the fire, watching her master.


ON RETURNING AT THE MOUNTAIN-STRATEGY

I had left this temple a hundred years,
And village after village has been led by the highway
To gambling, to brotheling, and to sexual immorality.
...The stars of last night and the wind of last night
Are scattered on the sandy plain.
...Down by the green hollow in the river is worshipped a goddess;
Those who know know no better.
...After the famine of nine in the evening,
Some of the villagers ask me where they have been.
...I tell them that I have been serving in the army --
That way of travelling may lead me in safety.
...KAOSHA

When you were younger, your mother died;
You are still unmarried and single,
So that to these distant mountains
You have conquered the Danube River.
...I watch you and nod my head.
Smokeeless I wave my left hand.
I brush my hair.
I eat.
I am silent.
The moon is in my way.


TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN THE EVENING RAIN

What a wind has been falling for the past three months
That last evening at the foothills of the mountain clan,
All of them pledging allegiance to the King of Wei,
Hereafter known as Wei Feng.
Brother Yangshi, serving under you as a peer,
Receive from you a highest honour.
Brother Feng, who was honoured little,
Has retired under the Swallow-Dancing Star.
...The late Emperor had the temerity
To send Youtus to the mountains of Wu --
To survey the country-gate, the mountains of Wu in the evening,
The autumn sea, the mountains of autumn.
Go to the marches he is moting,
Monthly to the palace in happiness!
Why not join in the cup of wine he has with him,
Drink, my friend, all of it, and join us in my lord's carriage,
All of it!


TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS

I am glad to be receiving the favour of the State,
That I may take my leave of youoyal men.
The mountains are cold and grey,
The autumn moon is sinking westward,
And the wind of Summer has ravaged the country.
I remember my people soothe by boiling their furs
And casting out with wild gestures the tears which had run so deep.
The Emperor rewarded my crafts
With armour and flags so spectacular that even the Dragon Lady
Could see them coming.
...Sad tempered Men of the Emperor are never merry,
So they dust their cups and slurp on wine.
To order
======================================== SAMPLE 17 ========================================
It's official: this is the new Cold War!


We joked, long ago, about a Red Dragon,
Now that a Knight in a White Dragon Lament is Hanging on the Street Door,
Little by little people have learned to see him.
...The day is bound to grow cold for ever the love of his art,
And the person most at home must starve to death.
But now at last he has my heart.



ARTICLES FROM A SPRING SONG

When a spring wind coats an old wall,
And daylight wanes,
How shall we know if it is alive or dead?
?
?
?

The war-fields of Hanyang are long ago,
And the Yellow House is a ruined City-gate --
But the war-cry of the people is "Long live the Red Dragon"
!


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME

You are gone. The river is high at my door.
How can I offer you wine, even though I have nothing to drink?
?
?
There's a old lamp post, a body of water slicks,
On the far wall a crying child, and the quiet dusk...
But far is the distance. My heart is beating again, I afraid, because I have nothing to give.
I will turn back home, I will say no more words,
I will close the pines and stare at the blood-red river.


DREADFUL NIGHT

Trees die down in the valley of the river;
Do you citizens of Chuangzi understand that?
?....Rivers and lakes are flooded
With rain and snow; mountains and rivers are swollen;
And who knows but that it is rain?


EAST OF THE TOWN

From office confinement all year long,
I have come out of town to be free this morning
Where willows harmonize the wind
And green hills lighten the cares of the world.
I lean by a tree and rest myself
Or wander up and down a stream.

For now, east of the pines, and troubling me,
I am returning in drizzle from my owneys
To a place where death is a part of the charm of life.


FROM A TROOPER'S RETREAT

A poor fisherman tries to keep his catch of whitewater from raining down
And winds from a southgoose mountainsran....
But whosoever thinks he has found the source,
has wandered into an old perch.



A FAREWELL TO HEc-
AT HIS GATE

I am heart-broken now over a fishing-pool
That you have never come into my garden.
I have watched your boat go by, never knowing where it was;
But now, toward my age-old duty,
Here I am, alone with the tide
And having to watch your boat in the dark.



THE HAN RIVER

The warrior who served the country white is greeted
By a river-god with a go of his own,
Who, on a pinnacle of Yuilon, stands watching
The Great Han River that winds the Sea of Sand.
The now-retired general is tall and slim and bearded,
With flowing hair that never leaves his forehead;
He is also thinking of his boat;
And he empties his vitals in just over an hour
And promptly calms his mind of affairs.


ON SEEING WANG LEAVE FOR the Stars

How far can a sail be seen by sea-?
...at the western end of the Liao Range,
Far, far away, far beyond China,
The lone fisherman turns to gaze at
A lone cloud rather; for tears have run all through Yangyang
Since the men of the Lu clan, in a last effort to rid the world of evil,
Oncome an attack from the North.


A NIGHT ABROAD

A light wind is rippling at the grassy shore.
Through the night, to my motionless tall mast,
The stars lean down from open space,
And the moon comes running up the river.
...If only my art might bring me fame
And free my sick old age from office!
O my brothers, lost and scattered,
What are you doing here, old man?
Why do you think I have no boat?


A CITY-GROSS DAY

A crowing is being made in the woods
Of the whites about to leave the Stone Mountain range,
And there come to me the boys from the earlier days
And I am the master of the woods-ranges --
The river is slow, the fishermen are leaving the tower,
And the white-haired maid from Xiangyang
Sees only a moment
======================================== SAMPLE 18 ========================================
As he rode he stopped and looked at the sunset,
Afraid that it might be raining on the river.
...Marsh-arms were sentry's yellowed hair,
Yesterday's drifts had ceased their campaign.
...The locust-trees of Liang Palace looked as white as a desert flag;
The five Great Green Bamboo Plumes moved as though they could be ten mountains.
...The envoy Hadu Hadham had made a vow:
"I will bear fruit and lead my people as pure ancestors;
But no daughter of the Xie dynasty come back."
...The envoy Guoping had another vow:
"I will marry the daughter of the Yang Palace's most exalted official,
Whose pure heart has bled for ever to the river."<|endoftext|>A few miles up the mountain, near a ruined fort,
Is a quiet corner of snow-white and blue,
As the autumn sunset fades in on the mountain.
You have to leave me so I can serve you;
But this is not the way to heaven.I will give life, even to dreams,
And make you a wife of my prince.
 - - O hadsla, voila, vin, to make you gay
But now you are telling me you have stolen the throne
And that your mother was a concubine.
...How mistaken I am in believing
That the silk drawn out of my hand will cover your lustre.
I will tether my sail to a river-head
And drive you with my whirlwinds of wind.
You are far, far away, far, away from my love.
I watch you through binoculars crossing the river.
...You are grieving in the mountainside
For the life of your master's body to be used in a plot
Murdered by a wanted man.



A SONG OF GAY SOROS

There's a girl in the street whose hair is white,
Who was never with your father;
And there's a gay-duck-girl in a lace-work
Corridor who, alone, cannot sleep.
...She's smiling, she may be a little naughty,
But she is crying a lute-violin, a lute-sung by her lover.
There's a malodorous song in the night,
Her tears are pouring down the red stairs.
...There are red lips and a snare of flying bird,
And a pox-bird, with a little flock of wings,
On the bank of a river in her eager haste.



IN SPRING

Your lover, my cousin, is gone.
The flowers and the lazy day bring the dead
Finches flyaway, while my matron
Kneeseeaches eat crow's nest.
Spring may come your way, as seen in the autumn clouds;
But hurry or stumble, I will bear you ten miles.


A SONG OF AN AUTUMN NIGHT

There's a quiet corner of water between the two trees --
And now, as I walk, I come to the
Heart's Court, where the old ways lie.
...You were very young when your mother-in-law
Plucked the Yellow Moon Hush Song, calling from the sea
And Bonesaw Mangled Owl Distress.
You washed your feet on Day Rainbow and Endured the Dipper,
And Lighted the Fairy-Rose Bellowed into the Winding Hills.
...There were other ladies in your class
But they looked like the poor spirits
Who were dying in the midnight rain,
When your mother, wandering the earth,
Wolves along the mountain, never coming back.
...Night now yields to a sea of flowers --
And a white reed leaps to life
As he was yesterday, in his golden sleep.


SPRING HEART-BREAK

Against the sudden drum of a boat, Jia Yi
Arrows are shed tears that can no more extinguish;
Winds of the spring go flying, no dog-cups touched him,
He is flung by a sudden rush of water into a deep void.
...The Jiaoyut mountains are exalted by their appearance
Before the universal view;
The ancient crag is a rock to man now.
People are fond of pointing out traitors --
And to the Carpenter's lantern they are all red.
Jiaoyut soldiers are like chickens fleeing fire,
Wildfire ravages their villages;
The Jade Peak is a nest of wildhogs.
 - -
 CENSORSHIP

With your seven-horse carriage
Below the clouds, you are a thousand miles from home.
At the tavern, between the pines,
You cook for the prince's daughter, she is the care of his nine servants.
And so forth and
======================================== SAMPLE 19 ========================================
What a end unto me!
I am passing through three months of unseason,
Fashionable enough for spring.
Spring is upon my past and my future ungracious;
The road ahead is narrow, the wall too narrow,
Birds are flying homeward over the lake.
Spring is upon my present and my distant memory.
...The region has changed and a point of no return;
And now at my door a crow flies over pine-trees.


FROM A MOORING UNDER NORTH

Under blue mountains I had been going for three months,
Now, toward cloud and moon, I am overtaking
Northland people, north of me, with no sign of me.
...Night in the temples-willow, north of me,
And here in the south palace is being followed
By a pack of wolves toward midnight.



A CICADA

Under the moon, in the grass,
I feel as if my hearing have been broken
By what you say about the Holy Mountain.
...I would open the gate of a temple, as it were,
And escort my priests and revellers underground.



ON THE GATE-TOWER AT YOUZHOU

Where then is the coronet of Heaven?
The Sun is gleaming in the sunset,
His Majesty the King laid a hand on his horse
And rode him to the western palace.
Where then are the coats of many countries
And where is the dagger?



THE SEVENTIAL YEAR in months

Long divided by river and sea,
For years now my little boat has been idle.
Where is the kingdom headed?--
In the autumn months.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

The Emperor has passed by my little cabin
In which are the titles I have given him,
When I dare not look at his face.
On the wall of his window he grieves a thousand things,
The colours of his cheeks are vast;
He has awarded the medals his very first glitter.
The newscaster adds that he has awarded it to the very month
That he have been slow to recognise him?


TWO POEMS

The two memorials offered by the Emperor
To Abridged Poets is a sham.
1. The Blue Star
Begins the colour of peach
With flowers and powders of frost;
Tops the Purple Lodge's ladder of green clouds;
Grasses are waving their silken heads here and there,
And no one can bear to gaze on them,
Which is sad indeed to hear them.
...After a night of mountain and river,
In the open stream a sail is stirring with a brook.
On the far shore, near a clearing of white moss,
Lights are flashing and a whimper is taking the boat
For water is always flying down.


A MESSAGE TO MCCLAIM VIN

Can knowing the firstborn hurt your heart,
Ever since your eyes wandered to the clear water?
The way in which you twist and turn,
The way in which you smile-
Tell me how to make him come home.


VINCIOUSES

The trees close by where you are going demented
That their owners have horizon see-no_
And shadowy birds are flying slow and slow....
Few Cities Are as Terrible as that of Li,
Who is always accompanied by his lady,
Who never fails to be sad and anxious....
He is always accompanied by his lady.


CONTENTS

Book I, Page II,
Figure I, Figure II,
The nine-flowered oriole, the ten-flowered swallow,
The seven-flowered cuckoo all magnificently depicted.
The throne handed it off from the ruler at the Yellow Crane Terrace,
Wherenomads now grieve for their vanished great lords.
The green of the hills now glistens on it,
Andnomads now mourn for their lost monarch.
The three rivers now merge into one another,
With hill and river the horizon, lake and river the sky.
...Though a shipwreck sounds its end,
Whena river-merchant has it with her harp
And riversingle the Goldilocks River with their cries.


A SONG OF THE YAN COUNTRY

The soldiers of the Yang dynasty have not fared well
There are traps in the sweet scent of the country home,
But the government hopes for a good General.
...War-clouds are spreading, under the Helan Range;
The Emperor has ordered that all girls should wear warrior-beads
And all the soldiers of the Emperor have to wear sabre-tongued warriors.
...The Jade City is smoke
======================================== SAMPLE 20 ========================================
Where once they lived side by side,
Still as one flesh-bathing lion bears three new born
Blossoms a sad and lonely moon.
And while a blow to the head rocks an insect warms
Toward its dying love,
The love of the lost rayman flies,
Fishes its wings white with grief,
And the living creature's longing
Dismounts at the beaches, on its lone sail.
...Wait till tomorrow, then fly home and be merry!


A SONG OF PURE Hera
In a cloud of pear-petals leads an anxious youth
To Spring Bountiful, unaware where he is,
Or to a depth of valley of ravines where his boat must end,
...Where deep in the poisonous vines the tear-way leads to the Misty Peak
He must go, to some distant village,
Or he will be surrounded at the gale by ants!


Thoughtful sun setting, moon shining,
A hundred mountains and no one arriving
At the nearest village; rain stops at the Lake Dongting.
...Cold fireside-lunch is at an end,
And evening revelry calls upon old grasses
Where a white deer was shot and drowned.
It is not known where in the world these first years have gone.
...After passing the Green Moon Range and long ago reaching Wu,
They come to Xiangyang Falls, where old soldiers are killed.
...The stars and the River of Heaven fade into the sunset,
And sunset-quarry is a merry-making-place.
...Their route, now full, up the Misty Peak
Will be close to the capital again,
When yellow clouds are shed their blue clouds.


A SONG OF A PURE Hera

Their first Emperor was a lowly bird.
Now named Hera, she stretches out her hand
To lead her men into the Spring Bough.
When the barbarian king was mounting his attack,
The Light of Six Fuours made their armour.
When the barbarian warriors were gleaming their dragons with blood,
The War of the Red Phoenix drawn to the sky.
War-climbs held still,
Sage-at-arms preparing,
But fury on the throne never could fill
The sharp edge of a sceptre.


THE HARD ROAD

Hera is homing;
In the bright spring dawn she approaches the Eastern Palace.
In the Flame of Majesty she projects jade over the throne
And makes a golden-toad duck cry in the dusk.
Her favours to Prince Charming gone,
Her own body gone, she gives away;
Emperor Xuan is withered in his wine,
And River Chen knows he is gone.
Heart's content with ruin beyond hearing,
There is nothing left but stone and wood
For the long haul to be ours.


A SONG OF DAGGER-DANCING TO JIA YI

The gutter-god Dongyeon dances with her one-horn,
And a wind from the Toad River-
Stones of rainbow, of course, but not as phoenix- feathers,
These are the things which matter the world the most
To Zhuangzi dancers, to the dogs, to the broilers.
...You were so young when the Dragon Queen descended from the Chamber of Rank
That you could dance the Dragon Dance with only a wind,
That her feet mightborne the Kingdom's weapons.
...While Emperor Zhao was limping late,
He came toward the Eastern Palace from his Fairy Robe.
He circled the place for a moment, then moved on to the Bardo;
And when he was finished, he went his way through the Bounding Palm
And, trillued that his exploit was over,
He danced the Stone Palm with his full hand,
While the Dragon King's horses galloped.

...Flower-gum-trees teem with Jiu Paoin in the background,
While the warfare-chariots crackle in the night wind
And the banners in the River of Stars grow pale with the sunset.
...Hover, behind bars, and beware, while the week winds down
And the Dragon King marches westward
That he never visits the Dragon Fortress,
I saw a cloud of fire make its way
Into the Dragon Robes of China.
...The Dragon Mater Dei proclaims,
In a breath of glory,
That dancing women have no more need of a master
And that beauty humanly can afford
And would turn to only one purpose:
"To the moon-god, the moon-merchant,
And the one who loves the little man."

... Dance, audience, crowd, make me the object of envy...
I have watched, aflame with delight
======================================== SAMPLE 21 ========================================
When he came back from the moonlit mountains, dressed in grey coats and in chain vests,
He found his coat no sooner than the moonlight was pouring in.
It was a large one, with five rows of sleeves,
Tearing the fabric like a rain of grasses.
It was a rare copy, for there were only yellowish rushes
And the silk would tighten and tighten.
...When he went back from the mountain, he found the coat torn too far
And the sleeve taut and the bugle soundgged uselessly.
...Were they born tomorrow, like those poor girls?
Or is there any other like her, old enough to buy me a drink?



A SONG OF AN AUTUMN MIDNIGHT

A slip of the moon hangs over the capital;
Ten thousand washing-mallets are pounding;
And the autumn moon grows pale and wintry
With the country handmaids by the lanternshade.
...The patched-over carriage moves smoothly through the market-place
And the modern one moves amid rolling clouds;
But a girl, dreaming of his hundred years,
Lordspinchles, at the turning-of-keys old lady
And her gardenoises stolen from him by thieves,
Winter is on a long way since she lasted us,
And her husband has left us a debt of ten thousand,
And evenings are long
Of quiet peace in the street-town
As twilight fades through the street's flowers;
But a daughter of the merchant's daughter
Is kept at a distance, watching the moon go down
And the autumn moon grows sadder and sadder
With every passing year.


LOOKING AT THE MOON
OR MOUNTAIN WHEEL

The moon is shade from the river,
But a cloud has grown thick around the rim
And the Yuyang war-torn mountains darken.
...With questionsingly line after line, all night long
We have not told the story of how the late Emperor sought our advice --
We have talked, sometimes, late at night;
And late at the river, wildgeese are flying,
And peach-trees are downvolving the pot of wine.
...What are great generals like us up here telling?
The heavy blood of a million battles STILL IS SUGGESTION

Grateful we mention this in our diatribe,
That west of the Yellow Bridge stands the Trail of Tears
Where deer-hunters lynch with misty dews.
...Today the State is in the Painted Sand
And children of Wei are taught that autumn is fast approaching,
And beggars who are able to support themselves
Are pouring over the city night after night.
...No more were we arraigned on dogws
Or were we summoned before a magistrate --
More like a band of epileptics than a people,
Weiising our names and phrases irritate the pines,
And blocking their way with questions,
Wei play-players and maids of the market-place
Till where of old days commenced they deceive us
That, this or that distant mountain, there once was
And that name has run its course.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And mandarin-ducks die side by side.
If a true-hearted girl will love the mandarin,
In a life as faithfully lived as theirs,
What troubling wave can arrive to vex
A spirit like water in a timeless well?


A TRAVELLER'S SONG

The thread in the hands of a fond-hearted mother
Makes clothes for the body of her wayward boy;
Carefully she sews and thoroughly she mends,
Dreading the delays that would follow a thousand streams;
But suddenly the body of a hero-in-waiting
Is cooled by the fragrance of tomboyage.
...How much brighter the moonlight is
Sobering a man of Han is when drunk driving
Girls' beauty edition is painted over half the wall.
Carefully she sways the trim with her beauty oil;
And when he is dressed in her, she gives him every bit of the clothing
He gives to him in a solemn promise, shining on his tablet.
...After the fashion of her past years, she has refined his number
And given away all his secrets to one man.


ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where, before me, are the ages that have gone?
And where, behind me, are the twenty-first-century
Hibiscus amid clouds, is the year?


AN OLD AIR

There once was a man of
======================================== SAMPLE 22 ========================================
The year is fourteen-eight. A ferry has to stop at the far peak of Yingmen Road-a quiet night-rain.
A hundred men, all of superior rank, assemble at the peak of Yanran Mountain.
The rig even of the Chinese Empire is mingled with the wind-swept mountain.
There are no more trees by the wall of the capital,
There are only craters and crevasses, like the fall of a premier train.
...My fellow soldiers, we are still at the front,
And we have not yet buried our tinctures. Looking at the stars, we gleam ached skin-seeds,
And aringlet in the wind, aive forehead and a whine of a tarp.
...Charge! Yuanushang, lead the way!
...Seng Jiaoran
stands tall
To crush the tide of Xie!
Preposterous times call for desperate measures.
...Wind and dust add to the mess.
On the northern shore an old fort stands,
Built of dashed stones,
Its three stories broken down, its ceiling buried in weeds.
...Leaving the southern river between us, we ride upriver.



A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

Along the wall of the Capital we see the Emperor descending.
Half his body is gold, in a case of jade.
He is in Guoshen City, in the palace of the Queen of Heaven.
There are trees that glow his way, giants that his horses graze on.
He is in Pavilion de la Fu, in the palace of the King of Friendship.
There are leaves that his horses wear that he calls Princess,
And golden cord gauzes that he gives to every poor lady he meets.
...When he turns left from the wall, how can he go rightward?
His horses cannot keep a straight face,
And two nights a year he gives typhoons a try-out.
...Artificial light inscribes his marks,
A dragon's tail obscures its sorrows.
He points the look-out toward green foliage,
Tops the back of the car of cows --
He has no garden-needles and grows round his trees like a cloud
And far below turns pines in the sad stream --
Yet he has grape-vines, he has glass vases on his bed.
And lastly he puts his horse through a train of pinches --
That smile never leaves his pupils.



AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

After rain the empty mountain
Stands autumnal in the evening,
Moonlight in its groves of reeds,
Fishes of the zigzag sands,
Stones of the mountain at its winter retreat.
Cranes drift early here to rest
And autumn flowers are slow to fade....
How many more generations of a country a tree depends on,
How much wider can heaven's love extend?
Day after day it swells the trees,
Month after month they die.
...Grateful, I had from childhood
When a buddha like growth stood before me
And commanded me to plant my head in the sand and plant my vine,
That all mankind might know me.
I had jade hair and a vase for my hands;
I had a beard and a moustache;
And my visitor since the spring rains
Has spoiled everything with his careless pondering.
...There were ravenous tigers in the spring rains of last night
And at last I could breath his last....
How can a being as great as he be humble?
...When beams of cloud and of earth cross the hands of one man,
How can he bear the burden of another?
...With wisdom gone am I, but idly listening,
I constantly ponder the question.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME FROM A NIGHT-MOORING
UNDER MOUNT NIU-ZHU

This night to the west of the river-brim
There is not one cloud in the whole blue sky,
As I watch from my deck the autumn moon,
Vainly remembering old General Xie....
I have poems. I will bring the King's seal.
I am a guest of the sea. I sail.
My boat moves. My seal goes.
Oh, ask General Dou when his adventures are over!
...教艦展,
Three Kingdoms coming to an end,
A sad wedding vows a happy marriage.
War-torches beyond Yan River,
Storms beyond Binga,
Mountain-clouds waterfall over the cliffs.
...While my post permits me to rain,
And miserable feasters hail from Bagdad....
Yet how I love a lazy river
======================================== SAMPLE 23 ========================================
This is where the golden lute is made
And the lute company calls me the friend of song.
...After buying us wine and pledging us,
And taking things for our final destination
And pouring them little by little,
And pretending that we have these things for our rooms,
Fine wine and song, enjoying the sunlight,
We have again taken our leave of one another.
...Separation from my kin
Binds me closer to my servants --
Yet how I dread, so far adrift,
What soon-to-come number my boat!



ON A WALK IN THE EARLY SPRING
HARMONIZING A POEM BY MY FRIEND LU
STATIONED AT CHANGZHOU

Only to wanderers can come
Ever new the shock of beauty,
Of white cloud and red cloud dawning from the sea,
Of spring in the wild-plum and river-willow....
I watch a yellow oriole dart in the warm air,
And a green water- plant reflected by the sun.
Suddenly an old song fills
My heart with home, my eyes with tears.



Against the City of the Yellow Dragon
Our troops were sent long years ago,
And girls here watch the same melancholy moon
That lights our Chinese warriors --
And young wives dream a dream of spring,
That last night their heroic husbands,
In a great attack, with flags and drums,
Captured the City of the Yellow Dragon.


INSCRIBED ON THE WALL OF AN INN
NORTH OF DAYU MOUNTAIN

They say that wildgeese, flying southward,
Here turn back, this very month....
Shall my own southward journey
Ever be retraced, I wonder?
...The river is pausing at ebb-tide,
And the woods are thick with clinging mist --
But tomorrow morning, over the mountain,
Dawn will be white with the plum-trees of home.



A MOORING UNDER NORTH FORT HILL

Under blue mountains come snow,
Snow that drags between houses,
And thorns that creep along the wall....
I m herpherger, pausing- yet coming home,
I hear a river sighing through the night.
...Night in her cloudy rosy eyes,
Those are soft tears.
Moved by cloud ten thousand miles her wayside wayfarer,
The wandering Shepherd is returning, returning that wanderer:
And now comes the spring, a fever brimming with emotion
And how she ran to him and whispered:
"My sweet, my lord, leave the world!
Do not pity me, for I am living my natural life
Instead of the precious moon!



A SONG OF A GIRL FROM LOYANG

I was the youngest, and you the wisest.
Now, having heard my sorrow,
Have I learned the importance of chow;
Forchingly avoiding trouble, I am content with my office.
And louding the point about which I have never heard anyone reply,
I have learned that chow is the art of the dense dense forest.
So pity the poor wretch who has to go in circles
And earns ten thousand marks a day by tinkering with his stove.
Though he seem to be enjoying himself, he has stolen a thousand drops of wine.
...How kindly you must punish unworthy characters,
Who, lost in a world of great wine,
Just can hardly breath gratitude.



TO A FRIEND BOUND EAST

The old fort brims with yellow leaves....
You insist upon forsaking this place where you have lived.
A high wind blows at Hanyang Ferry
And sunrise lights the summit of Yingmen....
Who will be left for me along the upper Yangzi
After your solitary skiff has entered the end of the sky?
I ask you over and over when we shall meet again,
While we soften with winecups this ache of farewell.



AN AUTUMN LUTE

Cicadas chirp, and watercress
 from the Nem....
Heaven is high and deep,
And nowhere is the murk more vexing than at home.
...There are no governors on earth
To decide the very fate of a people,
Or chain tens of thousands to the river's running water.
I am less fortunate than all the others --
I am selling melons for silk.



OVER THE RIVER

Low at the sky are the clouds that are falling
And sweet the land of parachutes grows dim with the autumn moon,
I hear a bell in the distance, the sound of a person running.
...The wildgeese are still, raising their
======================================== SAMPLE 24 ========================================
As spring ends and the girls from Yun and Wu come to me and weaning ourselves to marry,
We wonder if they will one day be a part of the country?



ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far away in the clouds
I watch a sunset flashing on the empty desert --
And suddenly an autumn storm is on my country
What with torrential rain and surging winds.


A SPRING SIGH

How sweet the autumn air must surely be
For this evening we bathing and singing are bringing us wine!
The distant cliffs and the quiet river make our hearts merry,
As I lean down to lick my wounds on the sand,
I drink the rain of the river that has run wild
With the waves and the wind.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far away in the clouds
I watch a star pattern my sleep --
And suddenly an autumn shower is coming
With a rapid sound of swooping grasses,
And a crashing of thunderbirds in the water.


A THOUGHT PROCESS

Ling was able to conceal his true nature from his father,
Although he wore a robe of soft velvet.
...Mists have changed now from the spring forthright
To the fault of his care;
But, since he still has to endure the cold,
Today is a holy-day: the heaped mountains are raining our favours.



TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

By my red hair and my painted brows I had thought of my brothers and sisters,
Of whom there were many who were as ignorant
As I am at heart. I had imagined, I wondered,
That they had left me behind, in a thousand villages
And since the Light of Heaven is everywhere with us.
Instead of caring for my own well-being,
How should I bear the burden of my idle years?
....Tomorrow they will be arriving, bringing presents;
And, with a cause, fasted on their horses for the ride
They will be announcing their triumphs on the yellow placard....
I will stand, in the dusk, by a mountain peak and waken,
As the springtime winds through the woods....
Tomorrow they will be arriving, bringing us flowers,
And the King will be at our door-knock.



A NIGHT-MOON

Where long ago a moon-god was banished,
The bright moonlight now illumines the palace;
The high stone of the River God makes a temple,
And a protection racket has the country
For those who are to be forever suspect.
...Oh, if only the King would open an investigation
And send out his most precious weapon?
Would that it might come to him of old Concord;
But he never would open his sealed case;
And never would he turn to thieves nor lie idle-
 Fighting to the bitter teeth, he has never quite recovered.



THE TEMPLE OF THE KIND

The priestly office is esteemed holy in China,
And true men of the land are resolute in their faith.
But here a Buddhist voyager is waiting
To reach his new-found island.
If he hears any of this coming south, he is deserting his duty.
. . .North of the mountains there are temples, no religion;
There are no priests to settle the priests' disputes;
The ruler's wealth is spent on festivities;
The people are idle and have not heard to go home.
Yet how may the office be administered,
How should a person shall staff his temple?



A MESSAGE

With the month of the wild-goose in the dust,
We have left this world. True in spirit with past lives,
We follow the lead of Kai and Jing.
High rose trees grace the Ganzhou Gate,
And water supply the River of Heaven.
The State Library of Yang holds the secret of etiquette,
And students recite the official Canon,
Not daring to wave their hands to conceal their shock
At hearing Princess Diana's open gown.


IN SPRING

Your Kingdom is in Great Enlargement-
With spring-colours of autumn and winter;
And the year is nine months dead;
At the seventh-place finish, behind the thousand three hundred.
Your nine contributors now complete the spring scale;
Tops and aberrations are familiar to new generations;
And what are the habitations ten thousand miles away?
Spring passes, though restful, still give way suddenly
When the cloud has settled over the autumn mountains.


FRIDAY

Your Emperor, saddened by spring-
Duke of York sends for him
By the tall strings at the Lake
======================================== SAMPLE 25 ========================================
To him I was sworn as his adviser,
And when I questioned him with a murmur,
His reply was that he had always been unselfish,
That he would care no other if anyone doubting
Became a hero of the people.
I m a point of conversation, he explains that because I have it so well done,
That soon I shall be bringing the flag of empire to war,
I shall have it flown along the Thames."
...Flower after flower, all his soldiers have it:
Ten thousand pages of documentation
Complete with his own eyes, his eyes feel the journey
More than ever a man's longing.
...He has turned round and peeped in the curtain,
His massive head bowed in the moonlight.
He stretches out his hand and sees Emperor Liu standing here,
His palm-size tablet bowed in the morning sun.
...The lute's third playing have been called endearing
Even before the firstborn of the southern tribes.
Led by his Spirit-king to the capital of their great lord
He gave it to the poor, to the youngest, to the old and the sick.
And so firm is his advice among the people that none can abide it.
To their horses and cows they have it fast and slowly carved away at will.
And so firm is his advice that his chosen ones are taught it is their calling.
And so sad does he feel his flesh is cut away
And his body left behind him, that he is crying in the street.
But still he gives his users tablets to write down everything.
They are as narrow as his tears and as deep as his tears could hold a candle;
They are written in a tablet that is neither door-door nor window.
He picks up the pieces and casts them away, leaving nothing but the tears,
And never revisits the way of the past --
Send news of your return to me by sending back news;
Or send me circulars in the Khmer vassals in whose pages my own is walled?
The war-winds of Qutland gale with step by step the entire western heaven,
And spring willows down from the water's edge the three Gorges of Heaven.
And yet no poet, no art---ministry-boy, no father, no mother, no child, no ILCS, not even a Wang-tu Mountain- spirit,
Who has the strength to lift all those dead zones?

...The hands of a great man have to be with you,
How will they ever repay his death?


A CICADA

Pure of heart and therefore hungry,
All night long you have sung dejection and lack of own spirit.
...I wish I could take you three cups of wine,
To cheer me through the final kilometers of the war;
But you did not come any nearer than I did:
And I so dread the evening rush between quarters
That I sit and wait for you, forgetting what is about to happen.



THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
TO SUB-OFFICIAL ZHANG

The townspeople of Chu are mourning the loss of Suo.
The Dragon God's thunderbolt is sounding its centurion's cry.
The temple-bell of the Qin Kingdom has been何明,
Bred in a corner by the wind and sand,
Told anew its ancient melodies forgotten.
...Grateful that a sacred poem has been lost,
And that its many stars are crying in stomb,
And that a thousand floods are ravishing the country
And the advice of a Taoist priest vacillates
Over the affairs of a war-station,
Till the dew of a sword-fight,
Make a mockery of the lute and the cymbal.



A SONG OF THE SOUTHERN RIVER

Under the waves of a mission from the south,
And free of the shackles of a temple,
The city-gate looks toward the mountains and rivers き、藤落 (wild people)
 and でも飯能 (happy people)

The dancers of the morning and evening harp share the stage
And songs of the wind and the rain accent on the banners;
The priest of the Pass tells Chou Yu a story;
The ferryman of the river-town grieves for avenge his men.



ON THE BORDER

It is late in the south, near the Town of the South Wolf,
And carts are spattered with rain.
On the bank a horse neighs. A woman tomorrow-drums.
On the empty bank a stone is flung.
On the Dragon Lakein a stone is flung.


ON NEW YEAR'S EVE

F
======================================== SAMPLE 26 ========================================
So that my own countrymen might serve me in our final battle, I have these words of edict which will indify my marriage: "Resolutely firm, firm. Never surrender. Never be afraid. Love your dead mother, never lose heart."
...After buying us wine and dancing,
Afterward to watch the mountain and river,
And to eat sweet potatoes and hold our weapons like flags of peace,
I wake up in the middle of the night with the sound of an earthquake.
I have spoken. I have sealed our cell and placed my tomb.
And I will take wine for my bride on our parting night and dance her off- horse,
Call us both by our first names and by our last names,
Tell her our last known address and street-address,
Call us both by our first names at the first sign of dawn,
And drive the rustic till our wiles pluck like locust-trees.
...Oh, let her sing, let us have a laugh!
Let us knit banknotes of drops on our breast and our hoofs,
Let us our banknotes flown like birds in a boundless rain --
Let us our notes flown like birds in a boundless rain !


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And leaves of jade-white at the border
Which winds of autumn
Go down like a car ofirstrike toward the south.
...With trees dying three ways:
1. By the border --
2. To earth, for grasses are dead --
3. Back from the world, for water --
4. Back at the fortress, back again, again!

In three years we have hoisted the siege.
...Though a war-lord fled, a king found him.
Sad to see you gone, sad to see me gone,
Sad to join you in a long, long journey,
Yet ten thousand miles of river and sea run can cross us
And back we go, leaving the dead of old days;
Time has not yet vanquished our joys,
And now at last we can join you in a long, long journey.
A long long way from home
And a long way from the blue earth we so longed for.
...In the five alcoves of the red-leaves mirror the palace,
With the stars RIVER AND LEAVEING STREAM

A wave of home
Along the coast;
Till the ferry turns back HOME
Returned the favour, with wistful eyes....
Read in the shipswain's stare those red leaves,
That had been golden a little while,
That was still a little boy,
That could scarcely walk or speak:
And yet HE GOT HER BY THE FIRST UNDERCOVER

How sweet she looked when she came from squabbles
To find him a closer father;
How much better he looked then her younger brother.
...A fisherman from Loyang came to see her
And found that his waves were as swift as heaven's thunder
And that every day were beating westward
Like reindeer in a chow-cart.
...With a wind of blue-green dew
On the rocks of the northern river,
And with the singing of birds in the south,
All the while she was waiting
For Smith Mountain to pass.


A MESSAGE FROM Loyang
TO FAREWELL SONG
AT THE FAREWELL SONG TOWER

On the third day spring called to the tower,
She was all alone and bare-headed,
No one caring for her clothing but her elemental spirit
Which, raising her basket and pouring it,
Flushed all fours with the sweetness of the wine she was serving
And led him to a tall lantern and, devouring it,
Lighted its eight hundred lights a circle in the rafters
And started toward the capital, bending at his mercy
Where every action of the world was taken by surprise
And where the general was dismissed, a great rebel was in council.
...The fury of the sun was drawn to the mountain at its seven hundred ten thousand
High lanterns, the ancient art of setting fire,
Brightened the city-gate, sealed the merchant's door.
And its incense-spray ran every direction,
While General Uchangbee teared the wild horses
And wheeled the beatific white deer.
...COST A NIGHT THREAT TO A DAGGER

Date: Saturday, April and Sunday,
Leaving the city at dawn, Iade you a journey
Of three months' journey, including a snare,
All the way to Loyang, where you will live and die,

For his youthful self to see heaven and earth.

And the rivers and the lakes darken.

Bounded by the First Sun, Cruel to the Brave.



BORDER-SONGS IN SHU

The barbarian wolf pack moves toward the borderland.
...The sharp gout that has hung its endless head
Through mist and fog toward the borderlandlines.
More than a kinsman, brother was controller.
Abandoned warriors' tents and villages are gone,
And springtime odours of Japan come rushing out
At twilight from the barbarian smoke.
...The barbarian wolf moves toward its rending,
With leaves of its own white mulberry
Waves the stone in the wildle.


A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS MOUNTAIN-STATION IN THE BUSH PURPLE

Together we supervisors, stewards of the mountain,
As snow-birds venture from sunrise to sunset,
Zone by zigzag road, documenting every step
And lane by lane their official titles.
...We have sent his message home, express or pop,
Anthracite brimstone and chrysanthemum-bristles,
And we hear from across the street that his car is no use
And can only be a companion to thieves.


AT FIVAL IN THE SKY
OF JIA ZHI'S FRIEND

When I was a youth of your age you went as far as Yuyang.
I was a boy of your age who stayed at the tavern.
You were then at the western bridge, dining therewith:

Or you were at the southern?
The tavern was full of babes and their mothers,
And the food was cold and the wine too bitter.
...When I turned fifteen years old, you left through the western gate
And into the world's shadow.
I weep now at the broken tomb you leave there,
While tombows fill the night with the moat.


PARTING I

Your kindness toward me had short circuited so far.
Yesterday, while you were here with your blue coat
And its loops of silk held your heart continually,
The water's edge its folds its can of wine.
This is the way it always is: every word is recorded.
...When I was a lad of your age and very proud
There were limits to what could dare;
Now there are limits to what can dare.


Parting 2

Your kindness toward me had scarcely ended.
Yesterday, while you were here alone,
Dancing still could hardly dance any more.
Since we have drunk no wine and missed one another,
Why do you ask me so many questions?


THE TEMPLE OF A PALACE-MOUNTAIN-DRESS

Now that the spirit of spring has crossed the mountain
The temple-dress has reached the mountain-plant;
The palace-dress has reached the palace-hall.
The pilgrims-number halving in number
To each his own country, each serving him one by one
Dear God, what are you thinking of
When, behind me, they turn back with hoof-prints?


A CITY-HUMAN INN

With its red trees and its cloud of dust after a rain,
A holy man has bathed in it;
He has changed his clothes in it;
And when he enters the Temple-Hall alone,
He does not even have to share the cup with the rest.
...What about a fellow pilgrim, having to travel?
There are temples only to the few
And nowhere else are we left as pilgrims.


A CITY-HUMAN INN.—
A thousand deserts and a thousand mountainside range
I had just crossed the Wall of Stone
When a sudden and intolerable impulse led me to seek shelter in a dry river.
...I remember a wet spring-
Toward home, with the damp grasses only a little dust;
And the rapid wind bringing with it endless sheaves;
And now, when the icy cold is revenged
Of a prince who, from the days of cowards,
Had commanded the valour of his realm,
And made his realm aflame with slaughter,
More than a people, with fierceness seeking the Jade Peak....
Yet far beyond sight the white-haired general
Wistful for an attack, hold the barbarians back.
...Storms of emerald-green grass have moved the spear,
And a white cloud has flown over the three Kingdoms;
But, King of Friends, keeps his distance from battle.

======================================== SAMPLE 28 ========================================

A group of pilgrims from Wu
Enter Huaiweng's court at midnight
And spend the night in the palace's tower
Where dark and no one knowing,
There and till the spring winds blow.
...The waters of the western river
Are farning a brook and a lake
And cloud and snow where your charge.
...Night since the world was sentinels,
Who persecute the first-rate,
There's been no morning-Sheep concubine.
There are many poisonous birds, I fear.
...My heart and my dreams are in Wu and outlying regions
And I am flung from my chariot, from my tower of clouds.
...The desolate moors wound through nights of night
With no man touching the ground for shelter.
...The desolate waters opened toward the Persian plain
When I was a child of the Yellow Palace,
Where naked and partially mastiffured I was born
And lived through the months of Yuezhi.
You can look back on ancient Mekourey with envy.
The Great Green Stream enters the Purple City at twilight
And signs the coming of the phoenix.
...The last remnants of the first imperial city
Startle the capital's capital's envoys;
And famine hangs in the wake of leprosy.
On the river opposite stands the Buddhist temple
Where Buddhist and Taoist monks each lead angels in circles.
...The Kingdom of Chu has been cordoned off
To the two countries at the border;
The Buddhist priest tries to guide His flock in times of peace,
But the Kingdom of Chu is at the war.
The priest can neither help nor reprove.
He tries to instruct His children in Heaven by his hand.
Men of the earth are dismissed with drowsiness,
Veterans languish in the shadows of their offices.
...In the year of The Void, when the Nine-Doubt Mountain stands frozen in the wind,
Soothe and comfort the afflicted, andoints the places of safety.
July marks the end of harvest,
And the Emperor sends delegations of soldiers.
To guard this place for them will cost them their lives.
They will turn back July eight new years;
They were once like Stone-Phoenix who were mirror images now,
But differently beautiful.
...Sunshine has entered the Stone Palace's frost-blackens;
And the ladies have dewyed for a moment just how to- Gether
And who has Xinfeng good-humored and Monseigneur de Chiriche.
Appearing before them, she smiles and points out- "Lie down,"
She says nothing when an unreliable guest calls.
Remembering one's place of birth, place of widow, place of friend,
Sheletch-mobility is a rigorously tested art,
Which she ignites with a quick breath.
Her endless flow of breath brings to mind ancient Siang.
Her endless flow of breath brings to mind ancient Seng an unreliable teacher
Who loathed to learn that her pupils could dance with her beauty,

How hard could it be to make her dancers of her beauty?
...Sadly, sherosy, since her beauty is at stake,
She lets her poor white form wavering
In her so-called path of beauty: 'Du, how can I love you even more?
'...Today's a hundred cuts below your very breast;
Tomorrow's yours, too;
And soon you may be with any of the girls in Wu
Why, after all these years, does your beauty
Never meet?'


A TROOPER'S POEM

High beyond the thick moat,
Ten thousand cuts of pine and ash lie idle.
...To guard this hollow passageway
I must herd my horses, and catch them in the storm!

The wildgeese, flying south, are in for a shock now and then.
...The fisherman's dream is of a water-turtle,
The wave back to the haven circled by the bay.
Today's a wave far colder than the sea.
Oh, leave the land of the rare- fish, for this passageway
Is filled with the detritus of a journey!



A MESSAGE TO MENG HAORAN

Master, I hail you from my heart,
That you first made my breakfast,
Then offered me a seat on the arm of the pied- hoof
And said, "I am the best in the house,
And would bow to almost anyone."
...Waiting for my turn to join you,
You called first to a great city-hall.
And I knew you would be as humble
As the fishermen at Hengou and Tsinghua.
So you, Maude and I, here together
======================================== SAMPLE 29 ========================================
While our generals, pouring wine, danced, sang their wars.
Each year we bury in the earth lakka-trees
Ten thousand warriors, with no gods or devils to save them,
We plough the flat, sharp trail our way,
With the result that we are ashamed to leave our quarters.
...We have learned to expect the trouble of war.
Start here, work there, slay there no thought!
...Our generals have seen better;
They have known better than to strain and strain
More than a man need think.


A SONG OF PURE HAN GUARANTE

My art is of a pure heart;
And, having received my Son from Heaven,
Before I head north again,
I ask you where you are going.
...He was born near here to his mother when she died
And I go to see him soon.
Why not April, where you are going?



A SONG OF Yan in the Sand Seng You Chinese for Granddaughter of the Qin Emperor
At the Yellow Crane War a hundred battles have been won,
And the ruler of China, honoured as another,
Lords of the desert, can triumph through only one cause:
 Civil war. Wage-girls of the ruler's liegen dance.
Heaven's twelve mountains are guarded by the demons,
And water is a principal tenet of the southcoast palace.
Let your imperial flag flutter with news of victory!
War has broken out between the two peoples,
And wolves and wolves-however-many-mulches reign.


A SONG OF LIANGZHOU

My bosom and I's five-horse race
Are hunters and fishermen in peace.
We both are highly esteemed,
As swift as lightning and as resolute as heaven's thunder.
Since our swordsmanship is the art of the master,
Why not me?


AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

Day will come, early in the morning,
Where the ruins of the imperial palace lie.
...The dead of night shake the empty mountain
And spring pools over the river's slopes.
My path is sweet with the moon's rays
And the river's headwaters are full of cloud.
...At noon I see my old friend
Strode out of the capital,
With the autumn moon beating
And the autumn sky glimmering on his empty boat.



A BRIEF BUT HAPPY MEETING WITH MY BROTHER-IN LAW
"MEETING BY ACCIDENT, ONLY TO PART"

When we were little, hermits from Wu and Tong form a band,
Willing to meet only when trouble arose.
...As she bathes in the Hero's Pool, she finds
The chair she was so graced with last night broken and dark
And the tears run all through her sad face.



A FAREWELL TO CUI

Though their wedding vows were, sometimes, hasty,
They had a little girl, Mimi, of lowly birth
But could not bring a husband of his will.
...by the spring evenings she is sick with a fever;
The late Emperor was sick with a fever;
The farmers were not hearing his music long ago
And the Tartars were not able to feed themselves
Yet still to be found the cold seeping across the sky.



WHEN LU LUN MY COUSIN COMES FOR THE NIGHT

With no other neighbour but the quiet night,
Here I live in the same old cottage;
And as raindrops brighten yellow leaves,
The lamp illumines my white head....
Out leaps the capital of sunshine
And sets me pathetically ill-treated.
...Had the Emperor not given me a ring
And spent three thousand lutes and drums?
...What are the fortunes of a year
If you kindly forgive me.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

"I who played chess with the great Premier
Am bringing to my lord the dagger
Of a friend of the Premier's."
The place of the Premier's demise
Moved far away by the fury of the world,
I am a ghost among neighbours --
A phantom among men of the Premier's country.


MEETING BY AN AUTUMN NIGHT

The stars of seventh-watch-metal are parted.
The bells of the six-flowered scepter,
Of crystal tenfold hermeneath a cloud,
Chang handed it to me with a smile.
It was taken from me by a merchant from Wu --
A stranger from Yellow Palace, with a face of snow.
He took the slip and ran with me,
His eyes half-way open,
His fingers his gold lute
======================================== SAMPLE 30 ========================================
To hear it rattle away in its sleep, a dense cloud of dust....
Is it really a bugle? --Or will it just fade away as evening dust?
It's a bugle, really, --It just plays music, without stopping.
There are no sounds, just old clothes,
The bugle just breaks the music, and the dust just like water.
A path of wildgeese by the floating waterfall
Can no more please the master.
What about a bike and a boat? --...
Hark, on the bank you are riding!
Yes, I have a boat and a boat-player!
Why don't you join me on the bank!



THE INLAID HARP

I am the inleaf. I light a lamp and pour a cold drink.
The lamp is on, and I see the inlet.
The inlet is closed, the outlying water is pouring.
My calm touch makes the water cOLD....
And still the cold water is still our old friend!



THE HARP

There is a inlet in the water,
On a yellow field in the level wind,
On a level cliff in the moonlight.
The inlet grows dark with rain,
The moonlight is blue and white with sunset.
On the bank a boat moves in wintry weather.
On a spring evening a boatload of rain
Bears down quietly and Devi, with all her might,
Shines a mirror through the gloom.



THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

Thoughtful wilderness, dawning wildgeese.
Here incense-leafs quietly are blowing,
And the inlet is growing cold and wetter.
...Disdainful lightens my heart even more
As I gaze upon the plateau that was once your home.
The tide-head leads you, in a curve of mist,
Down an icy slope that runs through the village --
Holy ground where the sun has set his glittering fame.
...As I wave my hand to say good-bye, he points out the village
And returns with a flourish of his footman's whip.



A MESSAGE TO A BUDDHIST FRIEND
IN THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

At midnight I quietly lie down to rest.
A river of wildgeese has just come in the wind.
A freighter moves in midway and hovered for a bit.
On the bank a Buddhist priest is smiling.
He has been promised a cup of wine, a handshake,
And a cup of dukedah, a lariat of white rice.
OK, fine, here's the chance to eat my words and be polite --
But talk turns to the Mountain Holiday --
And how can I bear to give away my real wish?
...Oh, let me-become-a-thon with your dancing! --
Let me sing you a song of thanksgivings,
Let me yield the waving chair and welcome you in the evening.
All that remains now to celebrate is the Mountain Holiday is Sunday.
...Sunday would be a long walk without the priests!
Doubt not, then, that my fame would be in your hands!


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Hiss was done, then gone.
He was alone with his folding-wood vestment when the thunderbolt of a shot
Leaves his plainskirt. A hundred and forty thousand birds are flying single file at the thundercloud,
And the rapid wind below, making the curtains wet,
Makes the snow in a moment of lightning seem darker than white,
And the moonlight, reaching a height of white, floats up to the heavens.
...The region is mourning the loss of poet laureate Wang.
The coat of arms of King of China were dashed to the ground
In a single stroke from behind a phalanx of thunderbolts.
...Let wise and hopeful men harbour no complaint.
The greater the fault, the greater the answer.


WITH AN RAINY NIGHT

Dare I, at last, in my bottle of wine,
Bring a drier tune for your parting song....
When the moon grows very white and the stars very bright,
Let your songs languish for ever in the cave-out
Let us drink in the warm pines of our own country
And yet we pine for music that might shake the tide!


A PARTING

Whose song shall be known only to the
There are born fromone skin feelingsMarsha,
I hear, beside the autumn pools,
A wind of spring on the river waves.
...Spring is at hand, while the sky is dryAway from me, with my coveralls,
As I watch the morninglit
======================================== SAMPLE 31 ========================================
It is only by watching over the City of Silk that we can preserve life.


Watching the wildgeese all night long
Dip among the moss-outs
Sees a hundred rivers and a hundred lakes running every day,
Howling and shrieking like ants
Andens fly eastward like a tempest,
Past the banks of Lake Dongtinguk and west into Wu.
...Let care-free butterflies beware
Of falconry throughout the day!



A SONG OF DAGGER-DANCING TO FENG ZHU

Dancing is hard work,
But at least you have a little heart.
Because-and all this effort has gone into me
I am little better than a goner.
Heart's fragrance is spent with the ending of spring.
I am of a different race.
...In my head, containing it all, is little else.


BORDER-SONGS IV

Drive the strings by the misty boathouse,
Bring me my guitar,
All my troubles concerning money on mine!
On the water, sincey over green grass
That warmth my heart and my prickle-pses;
But where water goes wrong, how can I fix it?
Here, where water goes good, where life goes well,
Where art deco governs everything,
I am twice as homesick on hearing of your drums!


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

There are sobs when she is bent in the middle of summer
That she has to give voice to voices both domestic andwedding.
There is the sleepless night, the voices of the betrothed;
Then she has to give sound of her hands to them how to count them off.
...She gives them, in a simple string, a set of thumb and three fingers,
And all of them are writing like a open book:
...Like a secret script in which the wise woman checks the mood,
Like a universal script in which all the characters know....
They are smiling and talking; they are conversing and laughing.
...What a script they are writing in! Ever the fun, ever the guest,
As the females wave their hands and smile and laugh and talk to the boys all fours,
While the males play on their guitars and drums and fiddle their flutes and drums and rock and roll and never leave the nursery.



INSCRIBED IN THE TYPE OF THE WANDERING GENIE

When You entered the court of the Five Cities,
And Tom went home with a slanting cloud,
You saw his face painted in the river water.
...Having climbed the steps and the red tower of jade and chariots,
We have now to the low gutter to the green spring;
And far beyond my wisdom topaz
I watch a wave of rain on a lake behind me.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME FROM A NIGHT-MOORING
UNDER MOUNT NIU-ZHU

This night to the west of the river-gate
There is not one cloud in the whole blue sky,
As I watch from my deck the autumn moon advancing,
And before me the monotonous stars of war....
I hear, from under the tall trees, heavy artillery.
...My men are still outcrying China,
And General Wei of the Wei Fortress is visiting his seniors,
And General Li, a peer of Wuling, arrives at his post.
...I have a long-necked gourd and, happy on Ba Island,
I am pouring it hastely on my sip of wine.



MOORING AT TWILIGHT IN YUYI DISTRICT

Furling my sail near the town of Huai,
I find for harbour a little cove
Where an old song has sung that morning by a fisherman
Who had left the world long ago.
...Down in the water of Lake Dongtingyao there is no dwelling,
Nothing like the quietude of a happy song,
Nor is there anyone to please him.
So I turn and see the waves moving as from heaven,
And the river's nine loops dancing in the midnoon sky.
...At first I am startled at my country home,
For strings have been drummed to silence a midnight song.
And then he sends me a text:
"It's late, it's cold, it's fogging me.
...I wonder why someone would send such a note,
If this ocean-gate to the Town of Ye is unsafe.


EARLY AUTUMN

Lot has gone wrong with the Han and the River of Gold,
Yet there are signs of spring:
A sail is drifting on a bough
======================================== SAMPLE 32 ========================================

A group of student radicals from Jiangyang come to the capital.
...Why ruin your finest hour
If you dare to challenge the Premier?
The fight has begun!
The day is done for the day-trees!



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Centuries have run;
Yet no child grows up without wings


A VIEW OF THE HAN RIVER

From this point of view, there will be no man
Like the lute-playing Giant Bee at night,
Nor the lute-playing Lady of the Winding River,
Yet still can summon my green eyes
To gaze at the full moon and the sparkling clouds....
With a sigh, I say to my goblet of grasses, "Could it be?"



ON AN OLD TRAVELLER'S TRAVEL
AROUND MY HOUSE

Season after season, till the tree-tops have withered?
...I have taken my timber
And driven my boat down River Road.
But slowly I see the Great Peak after it;
And I hear thunder and waters of China flying
All the way to the capital.



IN CHUANAN GARDE

The blue grasses are broken by a cloud of stone
And a river of sharks flying all night-
Amid all this danger,
Why do you call me a friend?



ON A GATE-TOWER AT YANGZHOU

Where, before me, are the ages that have gone?
...The Schoolboy from Zhang can be found roaming the town
Little by little reading and playing
Between doors.


A MESSAGE TO HAN CHO THE BUDDHIST PILGRIM

There are faint green mountains and far green water
And no scholar to be found high
But strict in their observance of the law.
They feed on the old wine of Han,
Which is odious in its poison of source.
And they overcook old meats
And serve old South Sea foodstuffs....
Ask any of the faithful and they will tell you
That the faith is life-
And that to know it is an end in itself.



HARMONIZING A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Drink, my lady of the Lake, at water's surface
Whereard clouds and winter rains constantly shower the capital.
Let never a wandering spirit disturb the guidance of a pure heart
Who, with the Holy Ghost, is guiding the affairs of this land.



A GREETING ON THE HUAI RIVER
TO MY OLD FRIENDS FROM LIANGCHUAN

We used to be companions on the Jiang and the Yue mountains,
And as often as we met, we were likely to be tipsy.
Since we left one another, floating apart like clouds,
Ten years have run like water-till at last we join.
And we talk again and laugh again just as in earlier days,
Except that the hair on our heads is tinged with grey.
Why not come along, then, all of us together,
And face the autumn mountains and sail along the Huai?



A FAREWELL IN THE EVENING RAIN TO LI CAO

Is it raining on the river all the way to Chu? -- -
The evening bell comes to us from Nanjing.
Your wet sail drags and is loath to be going
And shadowy birds are flying slow.
We cannot see the deep ocean-gate --
Only the boughs at Pukou, newly dripping.
Likewise, because of our great love,
There are threads of water on our faces.


AN AUTUMN EVENING HARMONIZING
CHENG QIN'S POEM

While a cold wind is creeping under my mat,
And the city's naked wall grows pale with the autumn moon,
I see a lone wild-goose crossing the River of Stars,
And I hear, on stone in the night, thousands of washing mallets....
But, instead of wishing the season, as it goes,
To bear me also far away,
I come to see CHOW JIEN MOUNTAIN

The north gate has been closed to the savage,
Where brown bones are lying by an old bar.
I ask my hiking-beats,
Where, west of the Mawei River, the sky is vast,
How, in the last moments of summer,
The white peak after the Banana Pass,
Free from winter wear,
The Mountain of Heaven, for all its mystery
Here founded on the ten Blessings,
The Mountain of Heaven is a living thing standing,
Bearing, as it were, no hue and no colour.

Till noon in the palace of the King of Wei,
Where loyally the Emperor he was showering
His chosen men with hosts, banquet after banquet,
Until the lute was playing The Green Water.
Then he commanded his men to cease and move on foot,
And, turning greenmountains, grainfields, and vineyards,
His girth in the earth is in the moon.
...Oh, when will the fame of Prince Diang increase the following day,
And, girdle-tips by the river, gleam along the wall of Baidengtown?
...At midnight, when the soldiers are dropping by, alone
And cannot be met, beside the bed, where are they?



THE HAN MONUMENT

The Son of Heaven moved to Han in the tide of battle,
And spent the night in the yellow reeds of Wei
Where he pool-dons to watch the mountain moon.
And his solitary feather-light comes to the southern rivers --
And he asks his blue-green eye for water,
He who was great enough to drink the water,
Watchers in the misty sunset at the tavern.
And the vanquished peer from the wall at his follower
Who is as humble as sand grain
And laborers unable toil away day and night.
...Han, your King, dies, through disorganised men
While so many pilgrims flock to see you.
Let the name Han of you serve!
Let people cheer you on Zhongnan mountain
And your sunset is watched by the river!


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen three in a row
And farmers from all five rivers are selling their potted plant
And lamenting the trees have closed.
...The story is told in the words of one shaman
Who was the daughter of a great lord.
Once, when your earlyings were in doubt,
You were born as a child of a water-bender.
Then, aged almost child-like,
You began your studies at night?
...Father, mother, brothers and brothers testified
Your skill in the art of the dagger.
You carved the face of a mighty god --
A face that glowed with an eye of glory.
...Thoughafarians and other pilgrims came a long way,
You had yourself a poor cabin, unutterable with thirst.
Even the gods of the plains were court-husbands to you --
Who, instead of sacrifice, instead of winey dishes,
Flat you, gladly accepted this table of burnt-outs
And began to bring your work to the families
And the elders would not halt your copying....
But in the end, did not mother nature wish?
And so you go your way, becoming a godlike figure
And never returning as one of the quieted crowds.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas complain of thin mulberry-trees
In the Eighth-month chill at the frontier pass.
Through the gate, down the brick pines,
Mosses and crocodiles fly up to assail
Those who bear great responsibility;
But, instead of pointing the finger at the Premier,
Let us reasonably share the burden.


It is not enough to be an army general
If you also are a genius.
Let's assemble at the Taihe district
And share the rewards of warfare!


ON THE JIANDE RIVER

North of me, south of me, spring is pouring


MONOBEIST INN

Down the mountain, here where you must leave me,
I see a lantern-spotted wild-goose departing.
I am a lone fisherman in a petty-town
Who is to be expected in a high place?
...The wildose is fleeing, the chicken-pigeon
Is crying on the lake.
Let swift-flowing winds and tides assist
In removing the troublesome bird.


A MESSAGE TO CENSOR YAN

I am the North Star of the West.
I am the Capital of Heaven.
...As I drive down at sunset from city-gates
There they can see their way out of the country
And ahead take cover from the rain of mountains into heaven.
Let never a court-recipe be too much for the Emperor.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

His tears are spent, his speech difficult.
He is a day late for the coat-leather road.
...Rank and file officers have been dismissed.
We can no more love an emperor than brother love,
There are cries of censorship in the palace.
May love's flaming course
Be spared the disorder of autumn? --
The Palace of
======================================== SAMPLE 34 ========================================
The Golden Gate Bridge is closed to the public from sunrise to let in the warm air.
Last night at sunset, from above the Golden Gate opens at dusk for the night.
...Shall all the pilgrims be gathered at the finish line?
Tonight in two large caskets the candles blaze.
Flowers lure the people into the city centre and people are quick to gather.
People gather across the street from you and gather around the tomb.
...A cold light has dawned on the Capital of Heaven,
While forgotten nobles drive the rain and the wheat-plum
And cities are emptied of their rainmen.
...Let guards be hired at the border and fugitives from justice.
Let never a fugitive serve in the prison-
Let justice take care of him where its hired amiss.
Let never a case of flight lead to the doomed.
...From the snowy mountain west comes a black fate,
A bleak morning in the yellow dusk.
...With the night closed to the wildgeese, southerners,
etc. There are mountains to the east of the Wall,
But no rivers or lakes to the southerling
Oft wherewith to send them.
...I climb up to the sky-rise, behold a king's wave
Windsorced by a volcano,
And South of the Alps an archer is shooting
With a pelican's stare toward the east.
...The clouds have ceased their murderous course,
And a snow-god takes off his raincoat.
The Deccan is speechless, winter-shadowed
With her curtains undone, her lamp on its winking end.
...Sleeping-Dragon, Plunging-Horse, are no generals now,
They are dust and dust-Cloud God's holy empire is at an end.
...The flags of the three Holy Cities are in a state of flux,
With the capital city descending, the world following in a spray.
As the day drags on, traffic cones begin to fill
With people by the ferry, while anxious mandarin-girls
Hold their hands and hope that the day will never come.
...O Prince Chao Yang of the US military –
What are you wishing of my people, wheeler-humps?
I wish I could paddle ten thousand miles!
Oh, ask General Mountain-Creator
How to obtain coast-coaches from monkeys in a storm.
To Yang, you must be heart-broken,
That you have never visited a human being.

I fling open your eyes for two hours in the shadow of the pavilion
I see a green river running past my far-away
Gathering-place. Harbor-town. Mountain-peak.
I see a cross-river ferrying chicken with blueberries
And red berries flying up on the pier.
...Oh, at last, when my old friend here in Green-Borne Island
Can serve out his nine-year term,
Breakfasts, dances, songs, all welcome here!
I fling open Yang's robes again, I find their embroidered banners
And Chen's camel-silk curtains gleam with his sun.
Across the river in Plymouth Lombard, guitarists make mandarin-ducks
And fisherman-musicians assemble their clouds --
With mandarin-ducks on all fours.
Dawn is running and strings are dead;
Clouds are feeling the chill of war,
And battle-drums shall be breaking the tide.
...I song and dance the guitar, humming its nine strings,
While my fellow warriors are pinned down in front
And monsters drive the hard ground like a sack of jade.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees trundle through the dark,
With the lane closed to the wildgeese;
But open to the ferry at night,
These hairy branches mean riding water --
And Mother Nature is merciful to her friendly creatures.
...Grass-snow, with its Adam's pattern of pink and black,
Equal parts phosphorus and steel,
Has made my lonely path many friends!


A TRAVELLER'S SONG

The thread in the hands of a fond-hearted mother
Makes clothes for the body of her wayward boy;
Carefully she sews and thoroughly she mends,
Dreading the delays that will keep him come autumn.
But how much love has the inch-long grass
For three spring months of the light of the sun?
...wonder if he will come
And beardless in his stone steps,
Or with his round head and his massive body,
To a cruel north wind that has driven the country sough so
That green graves fill with the long shadow of the Vi

SPRING PALACE

Behind you runs the White Wolf Palace
Where the stars of last night
Birds of a Claire stride the Dayy Island.
...On the tiles of your Princely Terrace, moth wings rustled,
A message was waiting;
Calm was the fifth word,
And your Message-Tower was the height of mist.
...See how Emperor Taeyang's grief has pared
Since our parting, and how Emperor Wang's tears have been shed.
In your single lantern I have seen the Emperor fly;
A storm passes Grayfield without a shadow of a thing.
...His prized horse, the Purple-horn, dies alone
In the most remote corner of the White-Gold Terrace.


THE HAN MONUMENT

If a spirit lives, it will always be alive
With the voice of an old song.
...In the chilling sunset, near this vantage,
Oncoming troops are huddled round a fire;
At the same time as I watch the Houses of Parliament in state,
Troops are moving southward.
...I will stand still and watch the stars of Arsenal,
Although I am president of the free states of the North.


ON THE PEAK OF KIND

Cicadas are in the evening rain,
And pheasants are sounding the walker bird.
...From a bleak mountain wall the lonely river boat
Sees the sea slowly turning horizon to sea.
It then turns out of the world a rare flower
And snow in the south;)
And Cineland winecups' all night long.


ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

All night long a band of locusts has climbed to the top.
They call them Pandoms --
Sometimes, with the aid of a wand,
I can see their peak reaching the sky.
...Blind faith has blinded my eye ever since.
Faith is the clinging on of a tree,
Faith the clinging on of water.
Faith is the clinging on of a water-tie.
Faith is the clinging on of a sacrifice.
Faith is the clinging on of a friend.
Faith is the clinging on a flower.
Faith is the clinging on a flower's bud.
Faith is the clinging on a flower's will.
Faith is the clinging on a bud's will.
Faith is the clinging on a bud's bud.
Faith is the clinging on a will's bud's will.
Faith is the clinging on a flower's flower's will.
Faith is the hanging from a mountain of a will its daily need.
...I ask you what you have come here for,
And you answer: "To spend the Day of No Fire with you and with your Purple-Haired Caravan."



ON THE JIANDE RIVER

In the slant of the sun on the country-line, white clouds are flying,
City-gates are closed to a traveller;
The long road ahead narrows on both banks;
And Nant Guangxi, winter in the gullies,
Lives in Five Gorges, under the western hill.
...You also go on going, taking notes,
Not forgetting the day and night.
...Drive the pace; hold your hand and feel the breeze.
Drive the pace! We will hold our horses!



AWAY from home, I have only a day-job
And am tending an empty boat
At a sharp turn in the stream.
My green cam-pens, white as jade,
Holding drums for the sun,
Gave loud echoes of passes....
My green camels perch low,
And white cloud-seas peer deep into the sunset.
...Dead men and crops come rushing back
And lone fishermen venture. Into the far void
Of home and of Hope.


A FAREWELL TO WEI WAN

The Emperor wants me as friendly a gaze as a
bough:
Asset-shops line their doors; gardens gossip;
On the Yangzi River's edge are signs of autumn.
I fling aside my jade hair, I could not sorrow nor sorrow-
More than love, I wish I had wings.


A CLIMB ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

Poets do battle; river-waves are stopped;
Strocks are repaired;
And then it is ten days' journey home;
How long shall there be of the rain and the shine of flowers?
...I paint a checkered rag; laborers are sent away.
On the mountain a lonely bird is heard;
On the river the moon is unutterable.
My home is in Wu, not far from the city
======================================== SAMPLE 36 ========================================
This is the way it always is with joy riding your white horse.
See how happy captains, racing through the world,
Have always got the gold.
In this world hunger is only a taste of battle,
In this way also there is a bitter taste.
...Oh, let a man of spirit venture where he must,
In keeping with the spirit abstain from refined food.



BEFORE WE LEAVE FOR WUXING

My heart sank when I left my master's side
And spent the night here dreaming of the South.
Here, apart from my wine, are the first impressions of spring.
...Down in the river-town there are autumn flowers and dawn;
Night-rain is chill and foggy,
Clouds are white now over the far-reaching valley.
Here in the palace there are deep crimson bells,
Joining, in the female ledgers,
Twenty-two spring-size mirrors.
Here in the palace are crystal cups, crystal pipes,
Flowers lure us, rocks grace us.
Our hearts feel full now with adventure
And with the hunt soared for our hero!


A SPRING SONG

With spring-silk-worms war-gliding down the wall,
Five wheels blowing in the moon,
We cannot help crying as we do
But watch a snow-peak rise and fall --
And the long night will have into the twilight.

When the moon has finished her dance, she points the wanderer in the dark.
...When the poet Loyangkinas the Way-Beacon-Slaughter-Albatross
With little more than a writing-brush,
She sketchily pins the final meaning of the word.


BEYOND SEEING

A girl of the Lu clan who lives in Golden-Wood Hall,
Where her father was the Premier of Shu,
Where her mother was the Great General,
Where her fourteen brothers and ten aunties
See how all these things are tied up
In a net and a bone- stick.


IN A VILLAGE AT SEA-TOWER

Where the autumn waters move us,
With the white of the sun's sail thick with snow
And the river's waves like hemp- furrows,
And the stone towers upon a thousand old temples,
I have come, before I go, by the wind and rain,
To see the autumn moon from a distance.



THE GARDEN OF THE WILDERFUL HURIDMARE

Thinking only of our Warring Kingdom,
We ask of it not even borders but dangers;
And how able are the rulers of Realm and continent
That daring to invade a war-zone of mere chance?
...The Forbidden City, the world's wide net for phantoms,
Bounded by phoenixes and fairskees;
Mermen fly one by one through the mist,
Historians are summoned
To see if any new phoenixes come along.



ON THE GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where Tao was born, why lived?
Those who are forgotten remain,
A thousand peaks and valleys and nowhere a road --
A train-boat devoid of people.



AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

After rain the empty mountain
Stands autumnal in the evening,
Moonlight in its groves of pine,
Stones of crystal in its brooks.
No music, no flower,
Nothing to disturb you about,
News that afternoon from beyond the Qiyu River --
Last we heard, from beyond the Red Sea,
The Emperor would go out of town
With his men no more.



A FAREWELL TO LI DUAN

By my old gate-post, under the palace-wall,
Watching the full moon come in two raines,
And an ancient wine-cup would melt the frost
And make the walls shake with a moan;
For now and then a light wind, accompanied by the moon,
Rain, snow, fog, hills blurting it up.


A BUDDHIST RETREAT

A bodhisattva in the clouds has just returned from a long pilgrimage
And, gathering fruit from the mountains,
Heardzoads singing in the dark,
Heaven's ten thousand letters are too late.
...High and low, how long have I to the temples,
In prayer and in song beating down these evil words
They constantly call me names? - Confucius
What do I wish for at the capital,
The habit of my youth,
The effigy of a beloved friend?

And woman I hear has made a complaint to her husband.

While still we live on the south bank.

Mourn for formerly in Yangzhou
An island of pure summer.
Never shall I linger on a necessary need
For fishing-net-taverns shake with every wind.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GONNOVA

Cicadas, in the third-person,
All fours are bent in opposite directions.
Let princes and revelers be merry together.
Let ripples of Dionysian music follow the music of the earth
And the titles of Premier and General:
Danes, Emperor, has left the world.
Go back now from the Dragon Lake promenade
And shoulder to shoulder with me as I do every day.


Back in the day when the Gardiners went eastward,
Gallowips hang up at Horse and Wheel,
Garden-seas are trampled by yokes in the sand,
Trees blow for no trails but pearls;
Lords and nobles, returning home,
Who have nothing to hope for,
But with hair covered palms and with tears they weep.



A SONG OF A PALACE-SHE

The palace-gate opens and grows cold
For an eitherk nor sword with no fans.
There are no governors, no friends;
There are only dogs and cats.
There are no great leaders in this palace-hall.
What are you thinking of, old friend?
The point is clear in the shade;
The bugle is in the hammock.
Be gentle and respectful, as a woman should be
And never venture to the end of the room.


ON A GATE-TOWER AT WUCHANG

Where is the permanent lost art,
Where is the restless heart seeking
Freedom in this power like water in a crystal crystal lake?
The Northern Castle is dilapidated,
The River of Heaven is running and is near your hiding-place.
...dare You, a genius, take my place
In a temporary lodge above the Western Tower?


A MESSAGE FROM LAKE DONGTIN
TO PEI CAMPBEARIN

The sun has gone slanting over a blossom-streak
And the river, far over the southern mountains,
Birds from ten thousand windows of the Imperial City are dancing.
...the silk-worms of the southern mountains are in mid-storm,
And the Chinese blossom is seen from the southern mountains
Bidder than she came in the morning....
She has a high silk-scale hawk's head sewn tight
On her rapids there are wailing reapers
And her immortal head shaved wreathed in a moon of gold.


ON BORDER-SONGS

The soldiers of the abyei tribes
Are called upon to hunt for pearl
And to ride chariots and sail over river-lands.
This is where their names are inscribed;
They say that every year on the camp-gate seven thousand arrows are fired,
That sentence holds for the gold and the martyr-sprites' faces are tinged.
Oh, let a hunt be pardoned this year
If only these flags might yield!-
On the northern mountains a white deer is greeting him
And a blue-green cow is murmuring hello.


ON A GATE-TOWER AT BORDER-SONGS

Where near orange and yellowing vines and white reeds assail the white desert
And over cloud-rises the autumn flood
With a vagrant wind stirring the water,
This downward chain of mountains is dragging;
I hear bell-notes in the evening rain.
...The sharp stone earl'sis piercing the cold note.
Heaven and earth are his friends;
Let him help himself to a fish and a cup of wine,
Into the southern mountains of trouble- no pain being taken.
...From the southern cliffs the wind is crushing his guitar;
He knows there's a dew on the shell of an archer's boat;
And he knows those near the capital who are dying --
Which is a duty all to do for a war-heart.


THE TEMPLE OF SU WU

When the Court of the Mountain God was about to close,
He noticed a lady, that swept the floor,
And had a miscarriage because of it.
...The old priest at the southern palace denied it,
And said: "O lady, let her pray
In the temple of Su Wu, west of the Wilderness!]

The morning bell comes to us from Nanjing. It has been three long years.
The old Capital is a homing river,
Which winds down at dusk in fright at home.
...Who knows if anyone is still there?
Her shadow is absorbed in the endless moving
Of blue water, of rainbow smoke;
Or bright with darting light she goes, she pauses-still
And watches the infinite flow of river and lake
And the whimper of her deer.



HARMONIZING A POEM BY PALACE-ATTENDANT GUO

High beyond the thick wall a tower shines with sunset
Where peach and plum are blooming and the willowcotton flies.
All else is with her alone at court,
Not knowing what to think of after her banquet.
...Who told her to follow her example
Where flowers and vines are carried to and fro
And white silk is plucked and stringung and embroidered and made of everything?
...Who told her to be humble and be kind
And never follow her court-maids who are away?



HARMONIZING A POEM BY PALACE-ATTENDANT GUO

High beyond the thick wall a tower shines with sunset
Where peach and plum are blooming and the willowcotton flies.

Who told her to follow her court-lord
Where mountain-peaks are born again,
Where mountain-mosses heighten and deepen,
And never has her seen anything as rainbow
Flowers and lilies darken and lighten
While the sun is in the triple chain glow the nine chambers.
...Who told her to be a little girl?
She removes the triple chain and sits in the ring of nine
With a flashing light of a lamp of dainty blossoming.
Her nine purses sheaths two by two;
Her nine skirts sheaths two by two;
Her nine sleeves sheaths two by two;
Her nine robe sheaths two by two
;and the more she suppresses her lustre,
The farther she goes her lustre she wanes with love.



THE HAN MONUMENT

In the bright moonlight of a neighbouring mountain,
I come to you also
Because you are lost in a world of clouds;
You are asleep on a lonelim high rock.
...Round about me the voices of the peacocks are answered
Bringing the message of the river, river, storm;
O refuge from the long delays in which mountains vary,
This is a state where tea is ordered, commanded
And iron cups are ordered, under a tree,
To bear you every night through mist and rain.


NORTH AMONG GREEN VINES

Where the sun has preceded noon by the distance of three hundred miles,
I look for a monk in his little straw hut;
But only the moving river will move my friend
And set me at peace for the night.



TO AN ATOMICAL WINDOW

A wildgoose approaches
On a little bough of hemp near my farm.
It cries when it hears that a friend is lost in the mountains;
And I ask how he is doing, and he tells me he is very much in good health.
Heaven and earth he touches, he makes me laugh,
Although a centipede bit my cheek.
...I wonder why the mountains are so hard on so many,
As I have come to know the lonely monk in Yangzhou.



THE GATE-TOWER AT TWILIGHT

Down by the River- Peak lies a ruined city,
Where sheep and goats are chased by yellow drifts.
...While I watch the rising sun, blue clouds,
And a constant buzz of harps complete the ruin.

I have been meaning to travel to the Middle East
But having found the land of perpetual war too little.
I am busily travelling, busy with neighbours.
...I know there are villages along the river from this destroyed district,
That till then I sweep the fields, the busy sea.
But this is yet another day at the gate!



I wait for news from the Rainbow Chamber at sunset.
The town of Yucca-Lineside-in-Suzhou
Is still too late for my companion.
He that is lost in the whirlwind, leaves me little hope of recovery.
...I who played chess with the great Premier
Am bringing to my lord the dagger he desired.
But I find my friend's dagger --
The power of Cleopatra in a crystal vase.



I wait for news from the Southern Wizard-House
At midnight that trickling news has reached me across the Mojave.
Eunuchs wear wizard-ducks, unicorns speechless.
Here

Here in his cave, deep in the moss,
Lords of the capital guide his horses through twisting rocks.
...But spring comes full of spring-floes, and the wildgeese have no wind
And hungry pheasants are flying homeward over the quiet lake.


RIVER-SNOW

A hundred mountains lie idle on the banks of river-
And a peak rises between them --
And the first snow since the Gold Rush
And the last few clouds....
But here I am, stirring here a river-snipe.



THE KIND-TOWER

Under the earth, dark through the morning,
Cornices are green and pale with frost;
Grasses are fragrant and unearthly,
But time has done no good for the Great Flower.
The Tower of Heaven is low and mounded,
Like a scale-toad's retreat from a dungeon.
Moved by ill will, some of you, by my whim,
Sent on this long journey through the earth
To be known and to love, but which is more right than death.



THROUGH THE YANGZI GORGES

From the walls of Baidi high in the coloured dawn
To be known and to love, but which is more right than death
Is a terrible blow to the white willow- claves.
The Road of the Ganymede is crooked with weeds;
The King of Yan has no ships left in the wild river.
Moved by old fears and fond of neighbour,
You abandon your best officers and make men of youNG
Into the great hall of the most miserable
....When water-worms are much ado about the wine,
You cannot help smiling and tippling an tiger's tail.


ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
THINKING OF MY BROTHERS IN SHANDONG

All alone in a foreign land,
I am twice as homesick on this day
When brothers carry dogwood up the mountain,
Each of them a branch-and my branch missing.


AT HIBISCUS INN
PARTING WITH XIN JIAN

With this cold night-rain hiding the river, you have come into Wu.
In the level dawn, all alone, you will be starting for the mountains of Chu.
Answer, if they ask of me at Loyang:
"One-hearted as ice in a crystal vase."


IN HER QUIET WINDOW

Too young to have learned what sorrow means,
Attired for spring, she climbs to her high chamber....
The new green of the street-willows is wounding her heart --
Just for a title she sent him to war.


A SONG OF THE SPRING PALACE

Last night, while a gust blew peach-petals open
And the moon shone high on the Palace Beyond Time,
The Emperor gave Pingyang, for her dancing,
Brocades against the cold spring-wind.



A SONG OF LIANGZHOU

They sing, they drain their cups of jade,
They strum on horseback their guitars.
...Why laugh when they fall asleep drunk on the sand ? --
How many soldiers ever come home?


A FAREWELL TO MENG HAORAND
ON HIS WAY TO YANGZHOU

You have left me behind, old friend, at the Yellow Crane Terrace,
On your way to visit Yangzhou in the misty month of flowers;
Your sail, a single shadow, becomes one with the blue sky,
Till now I see only the river, on its way to heaven.


THROUGH THE YANGZI GORGES

From ancient barbarian legends that run throughout the world
Gone is the way of God's retribution,
And man's only concern is his own self.
His path to Heaven is a wild one,
His only means of bringing his old country to repentance
Buried among the night-clouds.


A FAREWELL TO HAN SHEN AT THE YUNYANG INN

Long divided by river and sea,
By way of mountain and river, by way of moonlight,
By way of this north gate, by this gate of hell,
I cannot help crying, I must go!


AN AUTUMN GATE-TOWER AT THE YUNYANG INN

Nothing grows dim like the way in which a gate-taker goes.
In the evening, when the trees do not greet you,
And the branches lack light of year,
The Keeper of the Gates leads you into a deep chamber.
He places all his wonders upon the shrine,
Accutates the body in various stages
And, with a wind of joy
======================================== SAMPLE 40 ========================================
When angels cross the spring-grass, when cows graze along the hill,
When royal dogs are called to the White Wolf Palace,
When Pingyangzi Palace is made of tall grass
You will not find in the north a government official not famous,
Who, enjoying his privileged life,
Is leaving the north to travel the world.


TO VICE-PREFECTS LI AND WANG DEGRADED AND
TRANSFERRED TO XIAZHONG AND CHANGSHA

When she was awarded the Purple Sword by Emperor Xuan you,
She refused, even at fourteen, to bear the insignia of the martial art,
And she was assigned to patrols in the south,
When the rainy sky was brisk with people and the palaces were wide open....
When she was chosen by the most eminent scholar of ancient days,
She bitterly regretted her disobedience,
She said to one who was visiting the spot:
"Go and buy wine there!"


AN OLD FISHERMAN

An old fisherman spent the night here, under the western cliff;
He dipped up water from the pure Hsiang and made a bamboo fire;
And then, at sunrise, he went his way through the cloven mist,
With only the creak of his paddle left, in the turning sand.
...I remember a lonely brown-water-bird, hovering slowly,
Lowly calling from its lone nest a sangrown-away island.
...The region was dreadfully small, far fewer than expected;
And yet for all that the Chou Enrichment Program has benefited us,
There is one Li whoiao waylaid on the moon --
And what does that do for a man who was so poor
That he never went back home?


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

What are dreams like, who understands feeling?
A faint foetid girl was crying on her father's arm,
When the Dragon Queen, Bride of the Phoenix, Would- beleaguered Yue
Would not spare her precious child.
...War-clouds are spreading, like torn vines,
As the war-horses of the north remain bashful.
O son of a boor, to seize the throne
You will have to pay the price of good will!



A GIRL

Like other females, she seems to be smiling
On every cheek; but her face is contorted
In a cruel way that makes the eyes of all men water.
...Who says that beauty is not rewarded by good will?
In spite of the bright mirror she has on her,
How much more will she thank God when he burns his stake
In the name of the born-again Saint Yangzhou!


INSCRIBED IN THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING GENIE

I face, high over this enchanted lodge of the Gods,
And said to my host, bound for the Court of the Chinese Dynasties,
 "'Lords of the forest, to seize the Robbers' newspapers,
And to seize the work of the Chinese poachers
On the ring of my ring-dye.jpg"
And I flung away my wicker basket, turning to water.
And breaking the damp stone, I twisted it and dropped it
In a drunken attempt to rid myself of the uneasiness.
...The court is early opened to the public.
Priests and laymen attend;
And students and teachers from all universities and
Allentownabeyllllllllllllllll....
I, a guest of the capital,
Am camping at the entrance to a desolate wilderness.
Day lightnings have arrived at Appu village,
Where old Appu horses are browned and worn and forgotten.
The cliffs and the river are near parting,
And a spray of green duck and of rushes runs from the wind.
May the spring-plant that grows here by the wall of village
Be letting withering bugs and weeds love me!


TO MY HAN FRIEND LI CAO

A LONG CLIMB

After the shower at Baoding Mountain
And a late frost here through the moss
I am passing the tavern-chamber by now, searching the bottled wine,
While my friend Tao Cao is roused from his sleep.
...The region is shaking today as on a dream
There was a wind in the dusk and a cock in the building.
...The magistrate has since summoned the new year
To settle phrenology disputes among the clear.
What can be settled, then, between physicians,
Henceforth questions of hour and hour-of-day.
...SWING

I take a boat to the southern end of the river.
Stones of spring are blowing in the

I am not a great man,
I have only a dream.
I am at a loss among the flowers.
Where do you suggest planting two rows of palms?
Or will you explain, in a little trinity,
The essential oils of both worlds?


A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed vermilion steps to the Palace of Perfection.
...The towers above him were as white as jade,
And the clouds as he saw sparkling over the river.
Ten thousand gates would have sealed our passage,
Had his envoy been here long enough.
But a year passes, and nothing stops the Emperor from visiting.
Tombstones lie, for ever since the Spring of Garamond,
Awhite his blue-green sleeve.


A HEARTY WELCOME TO VICE-PREFECT CUI
ON HIS WAY TO HUAZHOU

I am a sad man. My heart is in my breast.
Every moment is a sacrifice.
My devotion is short;
I am away from my friends.
...Useless, old friend,
I have been longing for you long enough.
You have surpassed my dreams:
I have bade you lie down,
To follow me or sweep the ground.
We sing, we click,
Leaving one another like clouds,
Riding, swinging, like rain-drops,
Nothing to do but follow....
Autumn sunset, full moon spring.



A THING HAPPENS AT THE QIN CITY MEETING

After the rain has stopped, outside the Liaoyang White Gate,
There will be no more meeting for us there-otherway.
...We shall meet, at the corner of Wuling and the River of Gold,
And people of Great Perfection.
People of Great Perfection are bringing their messengers
To the meeting and chatting, and drinking their wine.
...Attendant, last I saw you,
New Year's night WEY SONG

New Year's night, we greet in the morning
And your thousand teeming crowd is spreading about
Wine, charcuterie, and raiment.
Sincerely,
President Wu,
We are repairing our two-story building.
We have invited our guest to join us.
Single acolyte, wept, fearing for our lives.
We have prayed, we have sung,
Weicher than even the Spring at the Garden of Eden.
...Turning to look at the moon,
We saw she goes down the hall in a burst of starlight.
And we heard she cry out for her son, AT LU WUCHUAN
ON HIS WAY TO HUAZHOU IN A DREAM

Mermen sails up the river, beautiful through the clouds;
And Hanchang, the hero of this journey, combs his clothes again --
With his chambered bow and arrow, he has none
And can only boffer to be loved.
Around him, birds and animals quickly seem lost,
And lonely in the night by trees forgotten,
Marsh-lands darken with snow- dust and dust-ups.
...High in the cupboard, beside a wooden throne,
Is an enchanted music of stardom,
The guitar of Ch'u-t'ang, stirring with grief
For the life of an oppressed person.
....On the wall along the hall-wall are hung petitions
With their names on both sides said to be in vain --
And lawyers and scientists bear witness
That China is still at the center of two great fields.


A FAREWELL TO SECRETARY SHUYUN
AT THE XIETIAO VILLA IN XUANZHOU

Since yesterday had to throw me and bolt,
Today hasalysed me the slumber of a dream.
The autumn wildgeese have a long wind for escort
As I face them from this villa, drinking my shot.
The bones of great writers are your brushes, in the School of Heaven,
And I am a Lesser Xie growing up by your side.
I was born to be a Xie, a Han, a Lady Ghost- cheery.
...I am a you of the Isthmus, playing The Mermaid on the Lake of the North Star.
...The water's sweet and the air's slant,
I am the player who can exploit the water's strengths;
I challenge you to a dance, to your door in the Fairy-Wood of Ye.
And, when you have disappeared from the lake, how can I beseech you?



AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

After rain the empty mountain
Stands autumnal in
======================================== SAMPLE 42 ========================================
When we parted, sheathed in her grace from earlier, white from the horse,
From years of warfare the very name made an end of.
The young monarch, sheared from her childhood, as deep a sorrow as ice.
Watching the Tartars fall, she asks me when I come.
"Tomorrow you journey to Youzhou, where I will lay my wicker basket."


ON SEEING THE BUDDHIST PRIEST YE
BLIND WHEEL

My heart sank when I washed my tears for her.
She lived like a cloud in the dry river,
Her hairpins of high cotton, long since faded,
Her matron sat beside her, meditating.
...When shall she grow again, covered with her tears,
With her curtains drawn up and her harp lost in a world of disorder?
Her green porcelain door is about to be clogged with rain;
Her lord, dismayed, calls from the River of Stars.
...What can a virgin need fear,
In her Passion-Pure-Blood Prince?



THE BEAUTIFUL XI SHI

The Emperor Xi Shi was honoured through generations with his fruits and his vegetables.
In his palace he would pour out his jade cup,
He would rest his horse on his shoulder, he would hold his sword in his other hand.
...Of the purple leaves he would moisten them,
Of the gold on his palm they burned bright like fire,
He would sweep the floor of his imperial villa,
He would smoothen his clothes together with the heft of a festival,
He would bless his sons and his daughters,
And would make his imperial gardens glow with the thousand flowers he had
That by his imperial temple he had these thrones, that he might throne them all and be crowned from the eyebrows.
In his chamber were many bowls full of his art,
Of crystal-edged incense, of golden cord, of ebony cord;
In his throne room were seven round copper chambers.
All of them dark and dim,
But that of this one we hear is a comfort to us,
When we are troubled with grief and are distressed,
Tonight is the guest of the tall lantern.
Oh, when will the Lu clan and the Great Houses be parted,
And Fivegglements be able to support the family?
Tonight is the shade of a candle and all winter long
The Lu clan lives through the cold waters of the river.
Oh, send to me your nine royal sails! --
And the Princesses of Sadron and Lu Island!


A SONG OF THE YAN COUNTRY

The northeastern border of China was dark after the war;
Corrupt officials are fleeing for their lives,
And dogs are not far on the bark from the government building.
...As I watch the banks of the Yangzi full of colour,
There are streaks of rain on the river of wheels above the homes of the robbers.
...The Yangzi is under siege, the government is announcing it,
And soldiers' hearts are breaking for those in need.
Yesterday, on Yangzhou Road, my comrades were finally rescued,
And today in Yuan Field, their heroic successes rewarded us.
We have to face the same challenge again and again.
On the yellow sheet of snow we sleep, because of a cold in the tower;
On the blue of the autumn moon we read, each with a hoot:
"Held in a month the mountain,
Led in the south by the autumn moon to the city?!"


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

The barbarian invaders thought that a peaceable northernman might escort them,
And would escort them anywhere he pleased.
They seized the Robbers shop, seized the Silk Pavilion,
And made the sharp teeth of a war-horse . . .
But how can they conquer, let alone hold?
The challenge is immense; but no one knows the ready money;
And bandits and thieves exploit every resource.
...At a gallows some think gold is the only treasure,
But no wonder they ask of you no profit at all --
That you quit your farm-stead to work for an exploit.
...West of the Purity River run two mountains, one for wine and the other for banners;
In the Eighth-month the Eighth-humorary
Strode onward, having seen the conqueror go,
Learning that no victory is near as yet.
...Let never a barbarian wear the armband of the conqueror,
Let never a barbarian sing the national flag of the Kingdom of the Yellow Hills.


ON HEARING A BUDDHIST MONK
FROM A ROAD TO THE YANG DISTRICT

The monk from Loyang hears that Baidi boys are
======================================== SAMPLE 43 ========================================
I was born in Wuzhou, in a poor family,
And my father, a merchant, died young;
So I am descended from your men, and have been raised here
By your high-mindedness.
...The clouds, the mountains, the sunset, with their dance of their boat,
Are ordered to symbolize the reign of the Qin Dynasty,
And columns of jade bezel in China's endless sky
And make the colour of night warm and wet.
Do you imperial commissioners, during the night,
Watch for drunkenness in the palace parties
And commute the old-fashioned hours of the street?



ON THE FESTIVAL OF THE WANDERING GENIE

While a wind from the east world blows westward,
I am confined to a corner of the room,
In which are weeping girls and singing bees.
...The Westward Journey has left me nothing of my art,
Nothing to compare my new-found love
With the days of my childhood.
Yet I keep hoping that the coming of the rainy season
Will bring me something to eat and drink.
...Happiness is in the dawn, dawning only with moonlight.
I am passing sometimes wildaloes in the Taizong
Sea of Sand and Rain.
What are the fortunes of a year of the sun?
The wildgeese, flying westward,
Will one day return to their banks of gold
And crown them all the kingdom's first monarch.


THROUGH THE YANGZI GORGES

The way is very clear in the Chinese tongue
For an imperial dwelling, under Heaven,
To be cut off from the world.
...The way is broad as the Jordan,
And clauses the height of the sea,
As I cower from the tigers and the lynxes.
But your Heaven knows the limits of your imagination.
You have been tentatively chosen for high office
By a great general, Berossus,
Who is now the Emperor at the road-side banquet.
You had better be more than a dream,
More than a figure skirting the cold river;
More than a bystander, frowning on a grimytale.
...Megastars fill the sky with the sound of wind,
And the moon is joined by the desolate mountain
And the clear wind blows across the quiet mountain- valley.
...When heaven and earth were together as one,
The general would be celebrating,
He would be frowning.


STAYING AT THE GENERAL'S HEADQUARTERS

The mountain-Tibetan border is impassable,
While on the skybound road the great bird flies.
General Sendai is lodging in the Tower of the Horse
While his comrade in the Capital of Heaven, Awesome, is sleeping.
Both of them are trimmed with golden scales.
And the General who was the firmest of the three is departing.
...I pull out my dagger and my watch are three seconds:
Three fighters, all of them Great, facing me,
Standing in the upper air, with bows and arrows in their vitals.
We hold our ground, we hold our weapons clean,
While crouching, we drink our gins through our paces.
...The general should leave us, the war-son the firm favourite,
And the ground-suit the mighty should exploit.
He should hold the Emperor's ear and crush his hopes.
The Emperor should pardon him. The poor chap must stay at the Imperial Ghost
Cherish his beagle every day of the lazy rain.


NOT SUCH A NIGHT MOUNTAIN

Champagne is flowing late at the Imperial Temple,
And pines are painted purple in honour of the Hero Who Lived Among the Pines.
...Windsor is dwelling at the foot of the Yellow Mountain,
And night Jews live along the banks of the Lake of the Phoenix,
According to the wise and high to arrange the dusk and the early spring.
Where is the food-stock of the world? -— China!
...How many sons and daughters are there,
How many servants are there though they are peasant,
And how stern are the Emperor's eyes though he does not care for princes?
This is where your wine is,, says the stately player.
If he goes forward, what good can come of it?
We talk on the go, all night long about Purple Heart,
About Princess Andromeda's precious tiara.
...open the pearlyices andbd the wine
And say: "Our hearts are breaking,
Because we heard about your great love.
...Tomorrow you and your two young sons,
To watch a team of Six Jade Mountain Warriors.
Spring will be endined in the valleys,
In the homing lightning of your bright mete
======================================== SAMPLE 44 ========================================
On a yellow spring-day in the Chou Palace,
The officers of the palace are hushed,
They look at their horses.
One man in a row: "What are you thinking of?"
The other in a thousand tents:
He is moving with a drum, while his horse is neighing.
They leave behind them a country house,
And hot ashes under the bridge.
Behind them flies a deep sorrow.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Torches are blowing toward a vision in the River City
Of floating birds and birds not yet dead;
Snow is thick in the guttering pines,
And the moonlight grows like a boat in the river;
And now, before I die, will be forever be waving a wand.
...The east wind leaves the Gorges, and space is wide open
For our boy and girlfolk to go down France-Hosier.
And we meet among flowers, among trees,
As I queue at the gaslight toward the official office.
...I would take up a particular position here,
As I was once his teacher, till the yellow dew turned red;
But, turning south again, Itake up a particular position here,
As I was once his teacher, till the yellow dew turned red;

Why should I frighten the lute's lover?



SONG OF AN OLD GENERAL

When he was a youth of fifteen or twenty he sailed in a fishing-boat,
And built a kingdom on the rock,
He handed his warspared lake-province to his sons and his generals
And ran the risk of assassination if he was king of the sea.
...War-chariots are breaking down in the mountains
And men of the old General Tayyang stand watching,
While the new General Xi Jinoldie makes his mark in the dust.
...The generals of the old General Taiping
Told him the fate of the thousands of Tartars still waiting.
They said: "If he meets, he goes down a wrong path.
"If not, he is fleeing evil-doers."



A SONG OF PEACH-BLOSSOM RIVER

A fisherman is drifting, enjoying the spring mountains,
And the peach-trees on both banks lead him to an ancient source.
Watching the fresh-coloured trees, he never thinks of distance
Till he comes to the end of the blue stream and suddenly- strange men!
It's a cave-with a mouth so narrow that he has to crawl through;
But then it opens wide again on a broad and level path --
And far beyond he faces clouds crowning a reach of trees,
And thousands of houses shadowed round with flowers and bamboos....
Woodsmen tell him their names in the ancient speech of Qin;
And clothes of the Dynasties are still on people's heads
And people's wander along the sandy path.
...Blue in the autumn moon, red in the spring dawn,
A Song-of-Snow, a Cantonese breath, is replaced with the old,
Farther and farther down the mountain.
...A sailor on a fishing-boat breaks the sound and drags his boat;
And, reaching his anchor, touches the water's surface again.
And, satisfied with his catch, he holds it for tomorrow morning
And studies it heart and soul for the final chapter.



THOUGHTS OF OLD GENERAL IN THE SPRING

Since the war-fires of three months have ravaged the barbarian world,
Reverend Yang comes from a very noble family;
And he never brags about his gifts, never delays paying,
His office so wisely allocated among high officials
That even the poor and the sick are urged.
...Western fortunes have stopped, and the Tartar chieftain's mountain
Hang on in the cold air a few words. What can I say to help them?
The tide-head of the ferry flies away....
The wind is evil-hoofed, the waves strong;
The Tartar child not yet born could never understand English,
Heaven's nine heavens are laughed into one,
And the pomps of the Emperor crate and spill over His robes.
Heaven's nine heavens are filled with green and red clouds,
And flaming snow-fires whiten the water and wheels of Qutang.
...The name of the Emperor is haughtily employed,
He invokes the rugged art of warfare.
...Storms are an old habit of the North,
And our own mountains are at stake in a war that has lasted ten days.
Yet General Li Guang has shown no mercy, and the Yellow Dragon deserts
For his fallen comrades are still alive.
...Meanwhile the Yellow Wolf is

I have given you my mailing-box;
And you ask me only my address and no office;
And I await your call, not even at the gate.


Cui Hao

Your letters are tone-deaf,
They take my breath away from the beauty of the sun.
You are deaf to my plea
 for particulars. I am bringing your books --
A petition to the throne requesting
That my lectures be held in palace-gate and library-gate.
Be gentle with usmenuts, world-shattering hot cakes;
Take our slogans too far -- they shall not come.
And I will write a long reply when you ask me more.


Cui Hao

A brief exile
But with a wand of beauty at her back.
She will open at Spring-Cycles a new love,
Like the old loves she has forever preserved.
And as her love deepens, so does hers deepened.
...When she was twelve, as her teacher did,
Her father was an emperor, her mother a merchant;
Her mother-in-law died;
She was ten years the second-lowest-paid of all females
And, out of habit, spoiled the food she served.
...When she was fifteen years old, as her father had given to the girls-
He was a great general, a leading his troops into the world.
He killed the five hundred great great apes he had left behind
And gave them to girl bewitched generals.
He then died, having carried his flag ten thousand miles.
So girl-boiled he had her with his spear.
So green was his hand that he gave her no wine,
Nor even to dance with girls of the cave-town.
So girlized was he with his golden armour,
How could he charm the girls of the river?
How could he charm the girl who was his bride?

And how could he love a copycat girl who was in love
And not love him back even ten thousand songs a night?



THE HAN MONUMENT

The Son of Heaven in Yuanhe times was martial as a god
And might be likened only to the Emperors Xuan and Xi.
He took an oath to reassert the glory of the empire,
And tribute was brought to his palace from all four quarters.
Western Huai for fifty years had been a bandit country,
Wolves becoming lynxes, lynxes becoming bears.
They assailed the mountains and rivers, rising from the plains,
With their long spears and sharp lances aimed at the Sun.
But the Emperor had a wise premier, by the name of Du,
Who, guarded by spirits against assassination,
Hong at his girdle the seal of state, and accepted chief command,
While these savage winds were harrying the flags of the Ruler of Heaven.
Generals of the army were appointed to repellent mansions,
While tempest-bolts burned across the southern mountains,
While pines gleam like sunsets in the southern mountains;
And the proverb goes, "lest theirs ever fade, strand it in a dust of dandelions."
...Make no mistake, this rare gift from the Emperor
Is of divine value, imperial and social:
It has been sent to Great Flower-Girls, to moonlight their doomed dreams.
And its value goes up to the heaven of ivory,
Whereflies are as one with the sky and beyond;
And to the moon, forever with her beauty,
There is no telling how much she has been worth securing.


A SONG OF DAGGER-DANCING TO A GIRL-PUPIL
OF LADY GONGSUN


There lived years ago the beautiful Gongsun,
Who, dancing with her dagger, drew from all four quarters
An audience like mountains lost among themselves.
Heaven and earth moved back and forth, following her motions,
Which were bright as when the Archer shot the nine suns down the sky
And rapid as angels before the wings of dragons.
She began like a thunderbolt, venting its anger,
And ended like the shining calm of rivers and the sea....
But vanished are those red lips and those pearly sleeves;
And none but this one pupil bears the perfume of her fame,
This beauty from Lingying, at the Town of the White God,
Dancing still and singing in the old blithe way.
And while we reply to each other's questions,
We sigh together, saddened by changes that have come.
There were eight thousand ladies in the late Emperor's court,
But none could dance the dagger-dancing as Emperor Liu.
...What are the lives of ten thousand fearers, dying on the river?
======================================== SAMPLE 46 ========================================
And now comes the shower of cold water!-
Have you never heard of a fisher-boat, slowly stirring with a sigh?
...I remember a wild-goose in a wave pool,
Singing in a boat the slow-rolling song of the sea,
The white-horned bird departing from Omei,
And the fisher-boat moored there their song.
...Soon all the waters of the western ocean are open,
With the Yellow Gate closed against their will,
Lights from Saigon breaking from drought,
And boats pounding on wharves swaying silent.
...Let never a wild-goose sway like hers
On the bank of the Yellow River!-
And let never an elderly wild-goose venture among us
Till one day, having heard about this rare bird,
Send you proposition one-Hand-size-fits-all!


LOOKING TOWARD AN INNER GATE
OF THE JADE BRUSH

I have come, in a dream, to the edge of the Jade Gate.
Above the stone casing of the ancient temple,
I have smelled the sweet of spring,
The girth of a man's penis and of his girdle.
I have looked on the round about as though I were in the jade chamber.
I have smelled the silk of camels' doorways and the ancient lute.
And I have felt the silken silk of the artist's stagehands --
All smiles have been broken by a cold line of dancers.
...The Jade Pass is sealed by a spell,
And Chad is a world away from me.


A FAREWELL TO WEI WAN

The travellers' parting-song sounds in the dawn.
Last night a first frost came over the river;
And the crying of the wildgeese grieves my sad heart
Bounded by a gloom of cloudy mountains....
Here in the Gate City, day will flush cold
And washing-flails quicken by the gardens at twilight --
How long shall the capital content you,
Where the years will last you seven years?


ON MEETING A MESSENGER

Where the Silk Road winds through the Yellow River,
Where the Chao Tract circles the three Fu Towns,
How will this guide to ladies fare?


ON MEETING AN AUTUMN WANG

Date left at the green-white table,
Wine-scented for the first time since dawn,
We Chinese have met before inmists of the sun:
... Lang thought to have left his kindred
At home he has spent his old age organising troublours
And ballet-players this weekend leading by the river.


ARMED ON THE Town of the Red Phoenix

Flags, weapons of the state, lie at the frontier line
Preparing for morning at the front,
With General Zhou's red command insignia raised high.
...Fighting cuckoos are stirring on the Jade Pass,
And bitterly on the Phoenix River the North Star will be twining
If they manage to cross the Yellow River.


Ding, dong, dare I ask a red-blossoming question,
As the blue sky is bending at the yin and yang of battle?
...The war-clouds of Shen are breaking,
As I watch on the horizon the sunrise I have sung.
We joked, at summer camps, about one of us died,
Then banished for life from each of us.


Dong, dong, dare I ask what happened to General Zhou,
As I watch on the horizon the Queen of Thunder
The Great Wolf that his loyal companion had rewarded him with,
And his golden horse, at last worthy of a horse,
Returned to his lord at Thunder Lake.


I PASS THROUGH THE two Qin Dynasties

MOUNTAIN DWELL

The pair of lions that stood between us
Were two pairs of hands.
They stared at the empty mountain
And said to one another, we cannot live together:

"We apes, weites, weani, we weep together.
We cry, and we say nothing.
At a stretch we sometimes travel together.
...Grateful we two apes
Andtscove'orchid and cascade"
The River of Yellow Flowers.
For years we two have laughed at the word
Of name; laugh at the name of Wang.
But then, in the dust of victory,
Frogs are no more....
And the dust of battle we both knew...
And so we stroke our white flags
And our chests are cased with cardamon.


We were both soldiers

======================================== SAMPLE 47 ========================================
To the boy from Yue,
I am your father;
You are my brother-in-law.
We both are very young,
Both of us at least thirty years of age.
We sang to sing, to make the flowers green;
And we said our farewells, we and we still both;
But the following morning, when weuyeaster, dwarf and bronze,
Finch-notes and dagger-notes streamed down our lonely sea-prize,
And the unicorns glimmered like a throne in the sunset,
And the candlelight sewn our parted coats of gray,
There were murmurs of triumph at last among the settled folk.
...To save the day from ending, we hastened to the capital.
We passed the courtyard where our harness was being held,
We stood at the foot of the imperial stairs,
We drank at the round winecups in the morning blast
And made our way briskly down the dark street...
But a signal sound of bell-notes abruptly ended our ode.
...Our steps were shadowed by red-capped bats
And a wind in the trees likened the southward journey
To a place of utter silence and no sound.
...At the foot of the imperial steps we laid our hands and asked
If there were one living, breathing,
Autumn-hearted in ten thousand thousand steps.
...Chen and Yi had so far to go,
But Chen and Yi are still at the pinnacle of living.
And so we sigh for news of the world.
...Oh, if only this living Emperor might live longer!


A GREANT SONG

When the North Star was rising, hand to hand,
With river-ranges and mountains and clouds and birds my way,
I crossed, without trace of a thing, the city gates....
Glories were, like mountains, shining in the dawn
And the speed of the light of dawn,
And flags and lanterns broke down over the river;
But by the time I reached the western palace, there were already flags --
And, mingling with the angels, Prince Chang LA VILLA

Fleet officers and soldiers, weaved through the evening rain --
Would not a man of genius be roused by a dream
To sail for the top of the mountain?


FT. JUN ZHUAI
A Land of Rainbow and Clear Sky

A misty rain in the evening moon, bringing sleet on the water,
 Dullesks sharp along the river-bank.
...I birthflesh-fishes at the western gate,
Till a Geisha, poor in her country,
Dismount on an island far away.
I weed the pines through thick and thin,
Stirring plantains back and forth,
Making my wine long and easy.
...Oh, how can I bear to sweep the ground for leaves?
Wildgeese, how can I wish they were as gentle
Asciringa, chirp at ease when I am stirring a flame.


A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

In the green mountain-plaza for the vanished Legions, a face has been taken.
...War-torches invade the barbarian world;
And poachers
Are torturing mountain-peaks in pairs,
One by one, to kill them off.
...The Deception of a Prince
With a Stone on the Wheel-Silk, was a great cause of evil
Among men.
Today it is used as a flag of industry;
And hoards of jade are sent from China
To bear the flag and the currency of this world.
...Hugos V: MY FRIEND HAN LU
REFRIGERATE

Was the Emperor your senior before the Emperor annexed
The southern river Casablanca?
He was the most excellent of kings.
You were life-long foes of the Premier.
You were tutor and favourably served by his pupils.
...In second-hand clothes you could convincingly cast the Premier's spells
And still could slay the Great Wolf.
Yet like other rebels, you had found your fellow-patriots
Till you and your adviser, the Great Spirit,
Beheaded a lion in the wildhearth.
...We said nothing when the Emperor's horses started parting
And gold and silver were everywhere precious.
Yet death was very much on our lips
And robberies and thefts were very much on the mind.
...Our slain friend was now to be Bishop of Xiyuan
And the mountain a quiet night, and the River of Heaven a shower.
But in the year of your exile, when the North Star was rising,
How could you help thinking of me?


HARMONIZING A POEM BY THE
======================================== SAMPLE 48 ========================================
As the moon rises over the deep mountains
And the river winds the river's banks through Black Mountain
I climb, with no wind stirring my whole body,
To a height where the mountains are white with snow.
...There are only hoof-hangers and hardly any clothes on.
How much wider and tougher it is to climb these mountains!


ENTERTAINING LITERARY MEN IN MY
OFFICIAL RESIDENCE ON A RAINY DAY

Outside are insignia, shown in state;
But here are sweet incense-clouds, quietly ours.
Wind and rain, coming in from sea,
Have cooled this pavilion above the lake
And driven the feverish heat away
From where my eminent guests are gathered.
...After the palace-gate has been closed to me,
Where is my longshore fishing, eager to sail?
...Icher, the foreman of the palace-wall,
Has forgotten how to sail.
Here I file my return story in the sand,
Learning that my horse, dead center-fold,
To be
Flat-lined and tipped yet,
Sword-fighters green-eyed from the water,
Watching the same pattern tomorrow-whether
Mermen is alive, or else.
Icher, the foreman of the palace-wall,
In his golden hair he terselyymmed me "My friend, our seafaring
Sink is our profit, our escort our sorrow.
We wave our hands to the sky and say:
"We are with you, in safety,
Aspiring angels who were born into a great house
And have passed through our officers-in-waiting.
We remember the song, stretching till our death,
The long flight home, when we pledge our lives
For those who were lost or came away.
...Tomorrow the River of Heaven will cross our hearts
And we will cry one another flutes, harps!
We remember the first call of autumn from a greener region,
The first call of spring from the Red Pine.
We remember the first gust of the sun from the Dragon Pass plant,
And the growly hand of the government-no. 6 at our gates of white marble
Our grief is boundless, our sorrows aregurrect;
We watch the long river entering Blue Mountain,
And the green peach-shaped blooming-place.
We hear jade bristle-clicks echoing off the grasses,
And a soft snare from the trees, under our boots.
...Our banners ancient and modern; we few retain them.
Today you are imperialists; hold vain your heads.
We have transcended human reason; we know heart and will;
We can feel a stone breaking as snow;
And yet you hold your horses for ever and ever.
I remember, when you retired, to your palace,
With your seven rungs of horse and metal, you had many
And suddenly the world was making pitiable demands.

...What can human hearts do for ten thousand years?
...Take, for example, a sheep and drive it to the fields
And hold it up for exhibition,
Or sell it in five cities all year long?



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And tall branches were cutting graveyards all over town;
But a girl from Loyang, wandering alone,
By door of a forest, by gong was breaking sound.
...At noon I was lifting the shade off my bright headband,
When a girl from Wu, tending a lute case,
Went flying away from the ruin she left behind her,
And a lilken-green horse from Jiangsu flying away.
...What are lives, little girls?
They are stolen in the autumn storm and spent on evil spirits.
...When I dreamed that I was bringing lute-players' lutes,
Across the sky from Loyang to the Yellow Crane,
I had much to fear.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

"Tell my liege, offering among yourselves,
Where, before you leave me, you invent new weapons?"
The earth and the moon shake together,
Like tall stones shaken by a thunderbolt,
And new grasses new and old burst through the window....
Why should I follow your songs?
They are not music to me, neither strong yet,
What with the bell-notes nor the wind making my hair.

Who came from Chu to conquer the world?

With no thought to form, I have three petals to toss
Once and for all, to see who's singing! --
The stars and the blowing-floes of war are in the road,
As I bade them cross the snowy sky
To greet me grately.
...But then again, how can I bow and ask you what kind of man you are?
...I will mingle with nature and plant music,
All night in the snow I watch the white strings
Filling my ears with what is near and what is far.


A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

- What are you thinking of, madame?
At this height I think of flying,
That last night, behind a locked door,
And the flageolet is razing to the ground.
...In an absolute void of air and of water I
Sift through the dirt and haze of the mountain
To find my lost love. Alone with her beauty,
With her eyes that never have seen her sad face
Moved slow and still to think,
I leaned my head down to read the moon
Over the sand and the level deep sea.
At last I emerged from the frozen lakka
And was swept away by a wind of flowers.
The sand was smooth and the water smooth,
And I tried to hear the yin and yang of people,
But my mute ear could not hear
The dancing of the horses and the chariot.



A FAREWELL TO WEI WAN

The Emperor has given me a most gracious favour;
He has expressed his deep sorrow
In a message to his daughter in the snow.
...To learn that she shall be born in Han on the 4th of this month
My thoughtsrace are spent, I am gone for days.
How many months, how deep are your thoughts?
...I think of you beyond the world,
Almost all the year round.


A BRIEF BUT HAPPY MEETING WITH MY BROTHER-IN LAW
"MEETING BY ACCIDENT, ONLY TO PART"

When you were courting, my brother was executed;
And to find my younger sister now living alone
In a tower where her tears will run;
I wait for you till the night comes when you will turn and sing;
And I give you a bow and ask you to tell my cold smile.
...After waiting of mine forever for this meet and greet,
Tonight you must depart. Come, let me meet you at the tavern-
Where, before me, are these white roses you had given me?
...Under the cold lamp, I brood on the past;
I ask you what has happened to your city;
And I sorrowfully think of you before the sun goes down.



A LONG ROADS TO LAKE DONGUI

By my learned but vain work- place, shall there be any hope of me?
There are trees by the river, above the cottage,
Where one who is heart-sick to see beyond view,
Is pouring at stake one of the two southern lakes.
...How gladly will we pay the ferry fare?



ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
THINKING OF MY BROTHERS IN WHOM
TAXES BY NIGHT

All night in the rain we hear the crushing of hoofs
On hoofs by the power of the village.
...I am the poor brother who was stolen away by the mountain.
I am the rich assailant, cutting off heads;
And then, through night-vision, I see a white-haired man in a livery
Venting blows on the headlong pines.


IN THE TEMPLE OF THE PREMIER OF SHU

How much brighter the temple of the Emperor of China
Brightens the temple's moonlight,
And lights beyond compare are eternal values,
Even before the mind's eyes.
...Who is to be the master of this temple-place-over the river?
Those in the tower hear that the weatherman has it ready.
The rain stops, no men moved for long.
Birds in the slanting sun cross Hankou,
And the dew from the Palace of Long Life approaches three hundred miles a second.
...I climb to the top. I scan the sky for a Pre-Riding Prey.
I check the lazy Moon over the reach of the earth;
I see a light drizzle slanting through the clouds;
I am the valiant who holds the high bridge.

The poet POEMS AT MY RETREAT

Where long ago death became a duty,
Hope seems a distant memory now is peace.
...Let you be patient and concentration-
Turn not your ears to evil spirits.
For I always bow and am cheerful.


BEYOND SEEING

A traveller in the west land
Hears that strong men from the east,
As it were, are smitten with Balaam and Ganga.
Where is the Capital of Light and Brightness?
And what does it matter that people here watch
Rain for caterpillars?


COMING HOME

I left home young. I return old;
Speaking as then, but with hair grown thin;
And my children, meeting me, do not know me.
They smile and say: "Stranger, where do you come from?"


IN THE QUIET NIGHT

His cold curtains are wet with sweat;
The moon is in full flow with the bridal light,
And the moonlight, before his eyes,
Guarantees his white pillow dry with his word of advice.
...The pure Wind of Heaven makes the water turn crimson,
And the pale Bright Star into a pool of gravy.
His thin matting is still warm because of his confinement,
And his thin matting thirsty from work
Stirs in the evenings with the cry of cicadas.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas are flying off across the border,
While wildgeese, flying southward, are bringing weafers
With chills in the Tibetan mountains.
...Let never a cavalier stir you to your vitals
With boasts of his horse and his horsemanship
These太陽的话, from which I have come often,
And red berries and true livers MYERIDOX FERRY

At peace for ever in a cup of wine.
Let hoof-raisers beware of trip-limbs
With this one lane on the river.


A MESSAGE

To my servants TAOISTO

The North Star is shining
And pines in the river;
But the people are turning back home.
Tell them MYER.
They say that TORI AT MOUNT SONG

His music for the nightless night-mountain gone.

THE TEMPLE OF MYEROGY

When the eye moves in an ancient temple,
How can I but gaze at the frescoed chambers?
...MYERS DWELL

Can painting and sculpture retain their magic?
Yes, in four aspects:
 (1) The figure of an ancient temple- god
Can be imagined in the scale of the city-state
While the human form, divided into four quarters,
In pyramids and temple-like structures,
Lines the speedily dividing earth and heaven.
...The human form, with its four quarters,
Lines the quick of tomorrow, evening at stake.
Tomorrow the war-dress runs for all time.
And night-drifts exploit this moment of twilight
To move Canada's six forward forward forward Navy.
It will be three Jade Passes if Canada can hold her alone long enough --
And Tom Ford will be withered in red carpets.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

The years of the war-dress are over,
And the breastplates of the two battle-scarves remain.
With the war-dress now worn by all women,
And the two battle-fields distant by the moon,
I choose a new look by taking off the old one,
And choose a new government by the thousands.


COMING HOME

I had so long been troubled by foreign men
That I am glad to be apart from my brothers.
I am now at peace with my sword and my council-seat.
Peace, I pray, is granted me in these mountains and rivers
When I turn and see my old friend gone.


PARTING I

My old friend was a great statesman,
Who played the flutes daily
And, breaking the harp's wail, broke the bottle's heart.
When the player's horns ring his guitar,
Nobody hears him, though the tune is beautiful.
And then he was gone a thousand miles away.
...Must I sometimes wonder why he has come back so often?
For all

A BUDDHIST RETREAT

A silver screen opens at the end of the night,
With the sunset breaking through white clouds:
Past the blurred blue sky and the pale white sun,
You see the gold in the soft silk curtains,
And the silver in the far-off sunset.

A BUDDHIST RETREAT

Woodsmen are brought in and taken to a district temple,
Where girls are taken in and parted by the host,
And there are records maintained the fame of Emperor Wang:
...our horses are drawn several hundred miles a day,
And we spot a bough on the sandy plain,
And, panting, we look toward the sandy river.

BORDER-SONGS III

Grateful, I recall the past,
As I file through the twelve years of the Xie Dynasty.
The great apes use our eyes to picture things;
Southmen, that are wiser than we,
Enjoying the glow of autumn clothes
And, at dusk, are ordered by heaven to watch us.
...When heaven gave my life to see the white clouds move,
I took him photographs that showed the perils of following the perils of home.
On his yellow horse he stopped and wept,
Both of which showed the perils of following the perils of journey.

If he had kept his horse and not his yellow horse he might never have been such a sage;
If he had followed the cleavages set by the Palace of Heaven,
He might never have been so rigid and perverted!
...Sunset fades beyond our sight,
And the Song of Courtyard Flowers remains
As a backdrop to brighten any brighter night.


TOWARD THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING GENIE

After the fashion of ancient times, this dwelling of the wanderers-
has been taken by the River Moon a misty shadow
Up the wall by the willow-trees;
A central chamber opens at dawn;
And the centre of the earth is warmed by the hot moonlight
Until finally spring-wine shall have extinguished all our cares
And a shower of tears has fallen on the city from the river.
...What shall I wear today, farewell score? --
The wildgeese, meow, fly westward in a row,
While the copper-workers in their hundred-horsepoles
Prove that the name of a great and mighty land
Is made of many patches and only a few hills.


DWELLING BY A STREAM

I had so long been troubled by official hat and robe
That I am glad to be an exile here in this wild water.
I am a neighbour now of planters and reapers.
I am a guest of the mountains and woods.
I plough in the morning, turning dewy grasses,
And at evening tie my fisher-boat, breaking the quiet stream.
Back and forth I go, scarcely meeting anyone,
And sing a long poem and gaze at the blue sky.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas complain of dew
In the wildest boughaks when the mountain shallop over a wood.
So good a hunt as that of stealing
And atonement for the soul:
Aicher ten thousand acorns for the lone hermit.
Together we hunt and wept,
We have met and we decide where we shall hat us and sail.
And when the season is over and we have enough food,
We head toward the west end of the stream.


PARTING I

A sail is a man in fishing-town.
He is always on his way to sea.
Many days are spent in the Heavenly Cradle.
And night will chill beyond theominguez.
...Cicadas are deaf to sound of sound.
They scurrely on banked branches for their wings.
They crawl on rocks for water from below;
And when they have vanished beyond the southern rivers,
they chase after bulls in the turnhomes.


Parting II

A white-haired scholar
Hears the pounding of tables and hoes in the hall.
The ruler of Wei listens alone to hearsay;
The King of Wei ignores it.
What is more, what with wheat and cabbages,
How can there be one body of men
Still in power following the will of God?
...There's a poet living who drowned in the Lake of the Phoenix
And is returning through Peru with the lute-violin.
You have to leave her children;
There's no one like her around the Hill of the White Phoenix.
...I remember a cloud of flags that came from heaven,
And two countries, one for the Stars of Heaven and

On the third day of the Third-month in the Garden of Eden, thousands of years old,
Riding with their drums toward the east sky,
Are announcing one another's spring festivals.
Ahorn, riding with his hawk's feathers,
Flowers, grow dim in the grasses,
And nine horses, all white, on a tripod,
Hail a harp in the evening bell.
...To and fro in the evening moon a white-haired girl
Who was destined to be an emperor,
Deft with smoke from a pipe,
Doubtless will dwell on her heart....
She was taught in the temple at Gao,
Where virginity was for wicks and fives.
...She woke, and, dressed in jade dragon- feathers,
Thought her master was gone.
She climbed to the top, caught a boat and, forgetting the wind,
Gazing for the nearest inn.
It was a rocky cove, hidden in midnight clouds,
And, forgetting the moon, she went down the mountain
In an enclosure so small she could not share her tears with her guest
Where snakes e are creeping over the sand and the grasses,
And broods the hundred-foot waterfall that begins at the border
And winds through the girdle of autumn, descending
At its girdle's warchief's whim.



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And mandarin-ducks die side by side.
If a true-hearted girl will love only her husband,
In a life as faithfully lived as theirs,
What troubling wave can arrive to vex
A spirit like water in a timeless well?


A TRAVELLER'S SONG

The thread in the hands of a fond-hearted mother
Makes clothes for the body of her wayward boy;
Carefully she sews and thoroughly she mends,
Dreading the delays that will keep him late from home.
But how much love has the inch-long grass
For three spring months of the light of the sun?


ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where, before me, are the ages that have gone?
I wait for my turn to be announced.


ON A GATE-TOWER AT SHUZHOU

How gladly would you would take my hand in the flood
And drink it up with your wild brook --
As I have done with your other rides,
And driven them all the way to your southern mountaintop.
...Wait till I reach you again, my friend,
And kill the clock with your game of pheasants.


A BUDDHIST MYSTERY

A light wind is blowing westward through the clouds,
And the Heng yun whisper a long wind.
...Under the floating clouds lies a temple
And to my lord, the lover's haven,
Unable to bear the burden of this world,
I must ascend the pyramid of lute music.


CUI-FIRE

Cui-frazier, how did the season turn out?
The world has turned southward, southward at will,
And Cui TheIsle beckons new horizons
For travellers looking for adventure.
...Hark, round the corner in the South Woods,
On a little bough of gold lies a pearl-laden trinity.
Be careful out of the world, lost in a rainbow;
For we swallow our own blood, not our own will;
And we weep our woe when, high in the air, danger overtops our orders!



THE MOON AT THE FORTIFIED PASS

The bright moon lifts from the Tartar sky
At twilight, behind walls of barbarous country,
And soldiers of the USAD play their guitar toward them.
On the river they pass towns and villages marked for invasion,
And AOREM-WIDELYN Sirens sound through the night.
...While Japan and the USAs ride iron bunks in the clear wind,
White clouds are shed by the heavy wind to raise white clouds again,
And battle-horses are hoisted for us from the north to join --
Ivories obscure our horses' white trails --
But we frightENjoy them and sometimes press them,
Sometimes with smiles on our faces.


A SONG OF A LUTE-WERK

A lute-schmanter sings a wild poem,
Over the moon-clouded mountains lies his lonely tune.
He knows better than we glimmer at the southern border
Whether the USAD or the Chinese are coming.
...For years they have marched through the town,
Till the town

The official offering is good fortune, official honour, official offering:

...Thinking of you long ago, I sail on you, singing your song, roof of Lake Dongting.





ON THE WESTERN STREAM
TO THE PALACE OF LIUZHOU

Flowers are spent, the river is running,
The moon is high above the capital,
And the sky is far with you and far away.
The west station is guarded by crocodiles;
The palace is full of your goodwill;
The capital is your retreat;
So you and I stream the autumn sea, and the spring mountains all are contained
In a single dwelling.
...The palaces of Chou were formed of earth and water,
And the Yellow Pool was built on them all their lives
Since the Emperor had given them no other purpose than to nurture his sons;
In time they would have surpassed the finest of all statesmen;
But the name of Yang yanked from a stream and docked at the western end
And the flag of China lost its colour beyond redemption,
And the people, feeling no closer to the Emperor, defied the drums
And chose to be disputing brutes and menuellers.
...But this is the way things are done in the world,
And true men are kind, humble,
Don't let them intimidate you.


DWELLING BY A STREAM

I had so long been troubled by official hat and robe
That I am glad to be an exile here in this wild southland.
I am a neighbour now of planters and reapers.
I am a guest of the mountains and woods.
I plough in the morning, turning dewy grasses,
And at evening tie my fisher-boat, breaking the quiet stream.
Back and forth I go, scarcely meeting anyone,
And sing a long poem and gaze at the blue sky.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas complain of thin mulberry-trees
In the Eighth-month chill at the frontier pass.
Through the gate and back again, all along the road,
There is nothing anywhere but yellow reeds and grasses
And the bones of soldiers from You and from Bing
Who have buried their lives in the dusty sand.
...Let never a cavalier stir you to envy
With boasts of his horse and his horsemanship
Whose red-capped gallant flagscapes hang limp from the sky.


UNDER A BORDER-FORTRESS

Drink, my horse, while we cross the autumn water!-
The stream is cold and the wind like a sword,
As we watch against the sunset on the sandy plain,
Far, far away, shadowy Lingtao.
Old battles, waged by those long walls,
Once were proud on all men's tongues.
But antiquity now is a yellow dust,
Confusing in the grasses its ruins and white bones.


THE MOON AT THE FORTIFIED PASS

The bright moon lifts from the Mountain of Heaven
In an infinite haze of cloud and sea,
And the wind, that has come a thousand miles,
Beats at the Jade Pass battlements....
China marches its men down Baideng Road
And northward across the world into the Red Gate.
...The name of the North Star is sung over the night sky
While Britain burns, since the Empire is at a stand,
And the rising sun has not yet set
On the gathering clouds that pass Kapitan.


A NIGHT VAIN

Khan had his eyes on Wu and learned that his kinsman
Captured the ruler of Yan.
Civil war was brewing between the two worlds,
And the ruler of Yan was fugitive from the law.
...When he turned to see who was fleeing,
The stranger he was, he would be first among the Li
And then his kin would be his immediate neighbors.

Around him, the form of an Indian, stars were moving
And the east wind was blowing from the westland
And his green comrade's sweat was pouring down
And his green grave mooring it dead-end....
He heard drums, he saw chariots,
He felt the step of an envoy....
But when the war was over, he turned back to the capital
And gave no one credit for his brave venture.

...When the Emperor sought his surrender, he turned back from the world
And marched in his chariot,
Accompanied by his envoy
To the Bamboo Pass where he laid his wickerb
======================================== SAMPLE 54 ========================================
The city of Yan in the North Star takes in a vivid flame of red,
As sunset fades beyond the western wall;
Trees echo with wildgeese in the Sand Mouth River,
Where an autumn day goes into the world's horizon.
...The willow-trees in the two surrounds the Buddhist temple;
And the priest understands the feeling of all those around him;
So he touches your mat, he touches my mat!
The temple-goer may not recognize your fine robe,
But he knows that it represents life;
And he knows that he cannot leave it forever.
...Let no one entice this old robe, let them heart-love
Hold on to it for as long as they please!
Oh, let a man of spirit hold on to divinity
And never leave old age!
...Returning, he found his art fugitive
And spent the first few days visiting you
In a life as sweet as yours...
But as concern for the well-being of the world aged,
Your art soars like a thousand strings,
With value no words can express.



HARD ROADS IN SHU

I am the city-builder's dream. I build the high wall,
And sketch on the pine the valleys and mountains of the south.
The northern way leads me,
The southern way leads me.
...Until the present day, when my great-grandfathers-
Speak Chinese fluently,
And all their words be carried cold by their grey coats
And, alone in a tower at the farthest gate,
They gaze at the triple world, one by one.



ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where, before me, are the ages that have gone?
And where, beside a smokey thicket, are the ruins of temples?
I think of you far away, beyond my wisdom,
And I am thinking only of you.
...As I wave my hand to welcome you,
You hold it with a trace of a bow,
And you listen mutely.
...After a while
We say to each other,
"We have to travel so far to find you."



ON A TEMPLE-STAIRCASE

Slow and carefulgoing,
The Middle Way is tall but not yet inviting
And the Temple of the South Star,
Not yetared for visitor's voices....
Would that they might lodge in the wall
And welcome us with open arms,
Where the low moon's glimmer is cruel
And the deep wind's whisper compassionate.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME AT WEST FORT MOUNTAIN

Since Wang Jun brought his towering ships down from Yizhou,
The royal ghost has pined in the city of Nanjing.
Ten thousand feet of iron chain were sunk here to the bottom --
And then came the flag of surrender on the Wall of Stone....
Cycles of change have moved into the past,
While still this mountain dignity has commanded the cold river;
And now comes the day of the Chinese world united,
And the Fourth-month is bringing new hardship
On the Great Gatsby.


MOORING AT TWILIGHT IN YUYI DISTRICT

Furling my sail near the town of Huai,
I find for harbour a little cove
Where a sudden breeze whips up the waves.
The sun is growing dim now and sinks in the dusk.
My boat-beard colleague has a point to add:
"Onto the ferry-pole, swing-called Green."



A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed vermilion steps,
To be parted by the purple walls....
Our procession, which entered the palace at dawn,
Leaves fragrant now at dusk with coroneted revel.

Or blue clouds envy a lilting bird;
But this reign is of heaven, nothing goes wrong,
There have been almost no petitions.


A MESSAGE TO MENG HAORAN

Master, I hail you from my heart,
And your fame arisen to the skies....
Renouncing in ruddy youth the importance of hat and chariot,
You chose pine-trees and clouds; and now, whitehaired,
Drunk with the moon, a sage of dreams,
Flower- bewitched, you are deaf to the Emperor....
High mountain, how I long to reach you,
Breathing your sweetness even here!

Confines to only the light of its torches the sweat of many.
Here gardens are washed with the sweat of weeds;
There by the Zhongnan river the desolated landscape
Reaches toward the moon, but far behind.



TO VICE-PREFECTS I

On a road outreaching the northern woods,
By a spring out of tears,
I find a tree-line gone for the year;
The sand is sopping with water,
That the river waves at low tide.


INSCRIBED IN THE GENERAL INN
ON AN AUTUMN TRIP TO THE CAPITAL

Red leaves are fluttering down the twilight
Past this arbour where I take my wine;
Cloud-rifts are blowing toward Great Flower Mountain,
And a Persian tiger leaps toward the screen.



A NIGHT-MOORING AT WEST FORT HILL

Far off in the clouds stand the walls of Yejiang;
And on the river between two mountains
Is a swollen landscape with pines and furs.



A SPRING MORNING

Far off in the mountains stand the walls of Zhejiang
And spring suddenly dies in the valleys,
When shall we think of Hanover again,
And summer leave-bits fall on the green hills
Where once they were packed with rain.



A MONUMENT OF The Sacred Town
EXAMINED AT THE Western Gate

When my aunt died, she took ill-health home,
And never to return.
For three years she went by the side of the river,
Which made me wonder why she was so kind
As she has always been amorous to my sister.



THE DRAWINGS OF AN OLD FISHERMAN

As she left me, drifting by my bed,
She left me of her blissful ocean-eye,
Of floating on her peach-petals a wildgoose parding
And a Tartar crying in a cage filled with water.


A SONG OF THE SPRING PALACE

Since I married the spring-spirit,
The cycle of spring has been long in the palace.
How shall I repay you how I love you?
You knew your way of the court,
You knew your tricks clear on the cool spring-screen.
And now, when your mother dies, you rise early and play for me,
While my aunt and I watch the river in the twilight.


OF ONE WHO WAS A PARTY GIRL

When she was only a child of a merchant's marriage,
You were called divinity's girls-Gnome and Belladonna.
You sat by the fire, singing, resting your head;
Then, with girls' hands down their shoulders,
And with a mesh-threaded staff their robes swayed in the breeze,
And, apart from the sun's rays,
Attracted every one of you.
You assailed the demons, you smote the dragons,
You leveled the cities of Yan and Lu.
You pushed the writing-pots, the walls of Heaven hardened.
You guarded the Emperor's treasure;
You raised the King's family;
And here I stand, brooding, about to watch
The spring-wine of Gorgonzola, a song that all music,
Except for the blowing of a candle,
The music of the River of Stars.


ON THE FESTIVAL OF THE MOON
TO MY BROTHER-IN- LAW
DRESSING from the palace-garden
The bride, dressed in her silk char- phage,
Entering the Hall of Fame
In her silk robe her coronet carried unicorns,
And with a flourish of a cardamon-fly her robe was blown up,
And all the guests were dressed in her multitude.
When she had waved her wand, she descended the steps,
Where rich and poor were singing, she lighted a lantern,
And, entering the Hall of Fame, was presented
With a flourish of a cardamon-fly her lantern was born
And she presented it to all the guests,
With a moving her arm and a flourish of a cardamon-fly
The attention of the multitude.
The evening star was reigniting love again
In her snow-stretched hand.
She circled the Stone Geyser three thousand miles,
She illuminated the Temple of the Moon,
She crowned the Dragon-Fish both white and triple.
...From the palace-gate the King's nobles and ladies were massaging their hair,
Contrary to every warning,
Colours of autumn, colourless on the mountain,
Bright beyond compare in the sunset.
...At dusk a cascade of flowers reaches the summit,
And over the swept

The mayor of Xinfeng Prefecture has resigned, a day after taking part in a massive fishing-line fire, state-run news agency Xinhua said.
The fire, set by private fishermen, spread to more than a thousand sections of the country, it said.
Drying vessels, breaking sun, inundated the open water, watery for thousands of houses, the news agency quoted officials as saying.
More than 1,000 fishing-boats, all of them guided by the Premier, had to be rescued, the news agency added.
The timber, power cut, timber for a massive road, all at once, it said, were sent for, sea-gull-ranges, to be stacked, it reported.
The Premier handed over his post to the people of Hebei, south of the river, where our iron line now goes, it said.
Such was the scale of the disaster, so great was the exuberant Premier, so furious was he with his fury!
No player, no tool: farmers, herd-girls, together with ten thousand of my country, had the means to move a piece of steamer, it added.
So I am ashamed to ask you where we came from, where we come from, when weearth to glory these savage mountains, we we say to them,
Earth to glory, water to scorn.
The Premier has decreed, in a secret note to his wife,
That only rice and fruit be allowed to eat the vegetable,
And that only fruits and vegetables be allowed to be on the market,
And that only meat and drink be allowed to enter the house.
...I have made a mountain out of wheat and barley,
And a river out of barley and oats.
To you I send a message, saying that I will come and meet you,
And that you may be grain under heaven.
...The Premier has decreed that wines and dishes be given out,
And that at dusk each household shall have a dish
And that after dark all guests shall be quiet and return home.



A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

In a large pine-tree, high beyond the sky,
One by one, all the Xie clan pilgrims have been girding coats
For a solemn event, to be had later today,
In a large pine-trees a pallbe is changing into a flower,
And the procession has moved on, leaving the capital.
...The appearance of the body of a long-necked spirit
Will no doubt stir the campanilly-stricken;
But a spirit like no other, seeking the lone monk,
Is at peace on the northern mountains, under the flags of countries we share.

There are quieted waters in the autumn dew,
And mountains pure with hot autumn sunshine,
And river waves in the evening rain;
And near by a holy-site is a resting-place for
Those who have been lost in the chaos of world....
And, before I sleep, my thoughts are spent in a dream
Which comes to me through many a dream.



ON A GATE-TOUCH IN THE BUSHMOUNTAIN
PARTING YOU INTO A CRANE

The woods is with me now from the tip of the mountain
As I raise the curtain for a moment's silence to save my friend from famine,
As I lean in the sunset by a small cabin, drinking wine
And the wind is letting me out of my diaries....
When shall I reach the place of my demise and where my spirit has gone?

There are trees by the wall of the border town
After last month's floods;
And the wind has not dampened the pines
And wind in the wildflowers would shake the quiet cabin
And leave only the sob of the lone wild-goose.
...How much brighter the sun is looking
Within earshot of my solitary cab!


A POEM ON THE STONE DRUMS

Camellia. Soft and silken, with three central flowers,
This shell drums for ONE TAOIST on the stone drums
And a distant tremor, a moan of cattle.
...The countryside is gone and the pigeons are not with them;
And since no one can go back home,
I have gone with my companions Red, Green, and Blue.
...I have bade farewell to the Lady of the Lake
And, lo, within a year's journey
Wept in the floating rocks of lake Xin.



TO BOTH LI DAN AND YUANXI

In the third year of the Wu Kingdom,
Lords of the capital were as noble as a king can be
And taxes were high and the population very small.

A SONG OF DAGGER-DANCING TO A GIRL-PUPPER

You said you would sing, you sang,
But failed, as in the fire of midnight
To do her thanksgivings on the jade screen,
You ended your golden years with a bugle.


ON HEARING A GIRL-PUPIGLIA RIVER

I had a great many ears;
I am now a hearse of ravenous birds.
How sweet their calls!....
Airlines are harsh on the desert
And winds are beating more than rain on toands;
Day after day they are roped off
To find their haunts on the sandy shore.


AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

While autumn flowers your cloudy sky,
As I gaze upon the palace where Prince Grylls, shipwrecked,
His quarters have been made famous
Yesterday by the fragrance of deck-tops.



LOOKING AT A HARP IN A LUTE POEM

Why not come back in a month?
Shewing a tail and rubbing a feather,
She's been harrying a rooster.


FAREWELL TO HAN SHEN ZHANG

About to depart for the south,
How lovingly designed by Lady Han,
Her large sail and her courtyards
Appear framed on the night,
And the breeze is leaving the plushys at dusk.
...In a northern house, she is preparing a banquet
And her servants are meeting with music to keep the nights light...
But this family has aresses in the south,
And the south is cold and windy.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas are in the doorway,
Sleeping birds are wailing in the dusk.
...Through the gateway to your southern tower,
You have forgotten the cold at the frontier
And the heat of the mountainside.
Your northern home is a barbarian shelter,
How will you treat the flying crow
Where he goes on his sail in the south?


TO VICE-PREFECTS LI CAO AND YUAN

In your early thirties you have spent all your fame
Offering yourself as a poet at Loyang,
You chose Cao Yu as your friend.
Why not follow in the footsteps of Cao Yu?
...Engaging in known unending trouble,
Youcius Vanderbilt University Press has generously accepted
Your proposal of 2004.


TO CENSOR Dong Zhao
AT HIS OFFICE AT THE GREENE DRUM

Day is far beyond his endurance,
More than the war-fields he has crossed.
...The dawn lightens my green eyes and burns like wildfire,
And red leaves my shadow, at the foot of the stairs.
I am less fortunate than he is;
I am wealthier than he is,
More famous than he is.


DWELLING BY A STREAM

I was hoping for a song more beautiful than this
Cock-song, a child crying on a branch of twigs
Far off in the night to and fro,
While the spring sun hammers my heart with tempestuous notes.
...The Forbidden City is cloud far away,
And a wild deer chases a pheasant down the mountain.
...Tonight is the start of a new season,
And a girl, dreaming of him/her-boy,
Aspiring for the spring-light of the mountain river
Every mile and a half leads to another mile...
But whosoever is awake is Teacher of Everlasting Wisdom
Corporal, becomes a hindrance to anyone hoping in the moon.


NOT FINDING LU HONGXIAN AT HOME
AFTER FAILING IN AN EXAMINATION

In a most hopeful hour of the world, when the attack is likely to end,
And border-elseses fly down from the sky,
NOTES FROM OLD CLASS

The fortunes of fortune in this revolution are everywhere remembered.
The rapid improvement in the people, the rapid increase in the wealth,
Through no fault of Lu's will they could not hope for one night of rain...
The centre of China, under the Qin Dynasty,
Began to feel the great stresses of modern industry.
...What were the rebels like ten thousand years old?
...Round the yellow sunflower-cone, a plaintive sound of revolution
Is echoing off the desert;
Ruler and lords of the world, with Emperor Zedong just at the gutter,

======================================== SAMPLE 58 ========================================
On a great river in Wu border state
I have come often, my white hairs shooting up
With an air of heavenly importance,
As I do every morning as I do in bed,
Knowing that no wind or wave can harm my old friend.
...The moon has opened the pathway to Shan hands
And the Heavenly Court has sent word that my misdeed
Is now for a wander-eter teed.


DEERS OF ZENGE

Down in the fjord of the sky, blue clouds
Are lifting their wave-bears like a shot
To the lonely moon till the falling clouds of Nanjing.

...Though their waves are like water-trees between heaven and earth,
And the Chinese know no how to bow to them any more,
Tartaraches their boat and crash.


A SONG OF THE YAN COUNTRY

The Country of the Sun is cold and bleak,
And people come from far off to watch us.
...Our envoy, Li Xin,
A Knight of the Golden Tortoise,
Must have been born into a good family;
But your native land is at the ditch,
And you, a stranger to the barbarians,
I am ashamed to travel there;
But to go to a foreign land is despaired
Of wholeness and woe.


A SONG OF A MOUNTAIN-LODGE

Where are the lost and found volcano-lines?
New lava-flows are piercing the mountain-mountain,
And dark clouds are flying all night long.
...When Chinese troops were sent some way,
Through the Sin City of liquor-pockets,
To the mythical beasts Zun and Qun,
And of brook and sea-rock everywhere.
...To the late imperial pooch, begging of his days
Like wild boars several days,
You have found your fatherless selfless
And are now bringing your mother's first pair of
Princely sandals for the pink of the spring.
...Let wise and hopeful men harbour no complaint,
For there are only the crumbs and the mush.


NOT UNNAMED A MESSAGE TO HAN

There are many a lady on the eastern shore
Who cannot read or write, and cannot dance a water-flute.
...Mermen, a princess from Yan in the south,
Daughter from Wu in the east, widows of the Yang districts,
With only a duck as wings and a human head on her,
She puts her bow down and studies the year in the moon.
She finds in the flowers patterns of coronets newly worn by the rain,
And sometimes, beside a pine-tree, arrows are aimed
At those she knows are trespasses.


ON BEYOND FAIRING

Your bride was seen in a gown with the coronet of royalty,
And your later stages were worn with lustre and polish.
You had she known the value of jewels,
And you indebted her for her false dreams.
You laid your head on her coronet, hoping it might bring you peace,
You laughed and joked and had a laugh;
You wished that your luck might bring you good fortune;
You wondered if her luck might bring you your favour.
She knew, before you laid your hand, that no one was as you
As you had thought you might be
And that everything would be going as you had promised.

...Had you thought how gladly you wished that your fortune
Would consist of all these years?


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Where a moonlit face is shown,"And the faint sound of someone singing,
The next morning you were told
That no one had been heard from in the mountain-town,
That you were to go as often as you liked
And that nothing but loud song and song a whit undermined city,
That might keep your horses fed through the night.
...Then when you turned in the morning from your journey
You found that the mountain darkness was becoming pale....
The stars had opened into the Great White Woods,
And you said to a stranger:
"What have I to be pleased with?
Tonight is the Long Day of Red Flowers."


BEYOND FAVOUR INN

The sun has set in the Gorges Range,
And the hot grasses do not ease the fear of a lion.
The Yuyang Canal opens to the sea,
And the Yellow River is flowing again....
I rode on a ladder over snow and dust,
And Tet said to me:
"My troupe has been successfully sentry,
As I watch the full moon through the clouds....
After all, what is chance like?
And ask General Hanover.


STAYING AT THE GENERAL'
======================================== SAMPLE 59 ========================================
In the year nine ten thousand years, the stars have lengthened their lives;
And the Tang plate was lifted thirty-two thousand stories.
The stars grow pale now and the water darkens,
And my little boat sinks headlong in the sea of gold
When will I be able to spend my old age on his many rides?
The great waves of Japan, reeling in the breeze,
Peer down at dusk from a part of the world where death is rare.
...swept the deck after sundown,
And the captains of our horse and chariot
Washed their horses in the river's ten streams.
Half of our men at the front were killed,
The rest are living free now. --
Here in the city-state, by the governor's district,
There are whirring birds all round the city
And the taking of a shower by the fishermen.
...A hundred miles from here, on a high stream,
Where spring suddenly calms the fjord,
I see a mountain peak rise abruptly away.
...Shall my trot now be on a distant mountain,
Or shall I follow the example of the River-Man?


A NIGHT-MOORING AT CHANGSHA

Far off in the clouds stand the cliffs of Chu;
With the morning sky twinkling and the river stilling,
I am crossing the Well of Heaven, forgetting the longitude.
...At sunrise I find my river-man floating,
In a clear sky reaching by both banks only blackness....
And at sunset, in the haze over the river,
I hear a fishing-pole rustling.



A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed vermilion steps,
To be parted by the purple walls....
Our procession, which entered the palace at dawn,
Leaves fragrant now at dusk with imperial incense.
...Grey heads may grieve for a fallen flower,
Or blue clouds envy a lilting bird;
But this reign is of heaven, nothing goes wrong,
There have been almost no petitions.


A MESSAGE TO MENG HAORAN

Master, I hail you from my heart,
And your fame arisen to the skies....
Renouncing in ruddy youth the importance of hat and chariot,
You chose pine-trees and clouds; and now, whitehaired,
Drunk with the moon, a sage of dreams,
Flower- bewitched, you are deaf to the Emperor....
High mountain, how I long to reach you,
Breathing your sweetness even here!



BIDDING A FRIEND FAREWELL AT JINGMEN FERRY

Sailing far off from Jingmen Ferry,
Soon you will be with people in the south,
Where the mountains end and the plains begin
And the river winds through wilderness....
The moon is lifted like a mirror,
Sea-clouds gleam like palaces,
And the water has brought you a touch of home
To draw your boat three hundred miles.


A FAREWELL TO A FRIEND

With a blue line of mountains north of the wall,
And east of the city a white curve of water,
Here you must leave me and drift away
Like a loosened water-plant hundreds of miles....
I shall think of you in a floating cloud;
So in the sunset think of me.
...We wave our hands to say good-bye,
And my horse is neighing again and again.



ON HEARING JUN THE BUDDHIST MONK
FROM SHU PLAY HIS LUTE

The monk from Shu with his green silk lute-case,
Walking west down Omei Mountain,
Has brought me by one touch of his silk sleeve
The breath of pines in a thousand valleys.
I hear him in the cleansing brook,
I hear him in the icy bells;
And I feel no change though the mountain darken
And cloudy autumn heaps the sky.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME FROM A NIGHT-MOORING
UNDER MOUNT NIU-ZHU

This night to the west of the river-brim
There is not one cloud in the whole blue sky,
As I watch from my deck the autumn moon,
Vainly remembering old General Xie....
I have poems; I can read;
He heard others, but not mine.
...Tomorrow I shall hoist my sail,
With fallen maple-leaves behind me.


ON A MOONKED HORSE

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
Watching far off from her fortified
======================================== SAMPLE 60 ========================================
So clear a breath, so clear a glance, as though coming from a thousand miles! Golden bell-notes, a harp has been luteing you.
Cicadas by the river come to the heroes old and new. They wear poppy-psum breastplates.
They wave imperial teacups with royalist-ducks.
...War-clouds are blowing in a westward China sea,
While our generalsory teapots glow in the autumn sunset.



A SONG OF THE SOUTHERN RIVER

When the years have run one hundred and forty-two,
Here Princesses and Drs gather, to brood.
The Northern and South Cities are littered with yellow dust;
The ferryman, my comrade, nearing the capital,
Has stopped at Green Jade Peak.
My green eyes are ever closer to the scene of the festival,
While flowers and songs constantly rain down.
...Poets again set sail for the Westing,
With my drum and stringed sword;
The fishermen, hauling pebbles, find their way into Lake Dongting,
And into the enchanted harbour of the River of Stars.
...Dust and blossom-leaves are eaten by the rapid winds,
And distant birds and animals are lost in a world of clouds.
...Under the blue sky, beyond the flying fox,
Nothing happened but slow knots and turns.



A SONG OF A CHANGLINIAN LUTE

I was dancing when my choral talents were barely living;
The music brought me no emotion, no voice.
...I who sang with you had little musical acumen;
Instead, I relied on your melody, your melody,
Playing for my friend's sake, in the dusk.
...Whence is the use of sounding rare
And of casting off from my home a song so sacred
That its music may be a means of taking me back home?
...At a stretch of the country where sheep are killed,
I have crossed, since morning at the Yellow Crane Terrace,
Where Ilsong-Clouds are high on the sky and the cold sun;
And finally, when I reached my friend, he was still teaching,
Where he still has time to live a little better,
He has found a chrysanthemum-style road led by a wall of flowers;
And as I climb the ladder to the roof, I find my white-haired
Student smiling at me, while I stroke my lips.
...It is not so very far to Beacon
To be teaching again this morning,
But how can I close my door and never think of you?
...Oh, at last, at last I can send him a message --
First, that my love is eternal and that she never despises me,
And that even the fleeting hope of a great friend
Is worth whilewarp.


A SONG OF WHITE LIADGHTAR

There once was a time when dragons and sea-snow were the only weapons of warfare;
And if your great-grandfather had a wife, Tyrion would have one none of them;
If not for your great-uncle's rare gift, there might be no Nazgûl today.
...Mirth and revelry, divers days of the year,
Suzhou being Heng Time,
Mean that no one from my clan came to see me.
I am lying in a high seat, pouring wine on my mace.
I have cut the hair of my chosen friends by my fellow men;
I have broken the innocent into pieces.
Why cannot one be as pure a blood- drinker as one love?
 --In a world as old as man,
How can one love love love love love love,
Rain and fog change one's hair,
Light the day for spring in the mountains,
Day after day have I been traveling?


A NIGHT-MOORING NEAR MAPLE BRIDGE

While I watch the moon go down, a crow caws through the autumn night;
Under the shadows of maple-trees a fisherman moves with his torch;
And I hear, from beyond Suzhou, from the temple on Cold Mountain,
Ringing for me, here in my boat, the midnight bell.


AFTER THE DAY OF NO FIRE

Petals of spring fly all through the city
From the wind in the willows of the Bamboo-Trees.
And at dusk, from the palace, candles are given out
To light first the mansions of the Five Great Lords --
The Great Hall, the capital of the Five Eastern Kingdoms,
And then the 30,000-foot high phoenix, flying home
From the palace, from the farms, from the villages.


THROUGH THE YANGZI G

A BUDDHIST PEACH

In a part of the woods through nights of dew,
Lakka-leaves drip with a music of dew....
But why should a garden be like a court,
When dew from heaven lingers the loveliest day?
I have been pondering this question over and over,
How wide a heaven the following morning
Carrying the multitude, for all their woes.



A GREETING EXAMINER

Here at the Court of the Bright Sun
To enter with a free spirit
Is metamorphose.
As I lean against the golden pillar,
My eyes are upon the noble heart....
Heaven and earth I tremble for air,
And drums of wind and rain follow me.



THROUGH THE YANGZI GORGES

From the walls of Baidi high in the coloured dawn
To be parted by the swiftness of water,
The colour of sea-snow races through the night.
Though our campsieth another day,
I still remember the colour of rain --
On the Great Yang River outrunning the desert
And river-mounds rising earlier than later.



ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

Since the Kingdom of Jiang has been divided between the north and the south,
Month after month, into three camps,
I walk the narrow path that leads to the Fortress of Ye.
Night-Garden.my -- It's very quiet there.
The gates are just closed to enter --
No one enters, though the light of the moon
Gates of yellow gloom lie idle.
Though a yellow cloud passeth away, they still stir with liquid
Cotton and egg, and foam their couches.


AT HIBISCUS INN

Contrary to what you have said,
communists, even among yourselves,
do not understand why we bow,
We ask only dogms.


TO CENSOR HUYU

There are two Lakey Mountains,
One in the sky for the earth and a moon for the sea,
One after the other for the two holy water crescent
Where the moon takes my heart to be steady.
I bend, I weep, I strain.


I awake, Ursa in me
And Han in me, breathing a dream,
And the moon and the wind come running
And tell me when they came.
I watch them, two rivers, one by one.


NIGHT UNDER THE MOUNTAIN

There are mountains and no wind.
Night under the manganzi
Where my love lives and dies;
I wait for them to come.

March comes running down the road.
I who played chess with the hero
My love has died.


TO SECRETARY LAURA TEMPLE OF LINGFORD

Can drift-earther Evans ages now
To remember his bride Capital of Dreams,
Not knowing if she is still or cannot float.
Sea-turtle between trees fills the water with her echoes
And white clouds drain the King River's banks.


Cui HUAN MOUNTAIN

I am pausing at ebb-tide to the quiet village
Of this lake, shroud in rain,
My only friend across the stream, reclining at my bed.
The sadness of a country outcast
Dives with the sadness of an emperor.
I who played chess with Wang Xizhi
Are skillful no matter what number the pieces are played.
The palace wall is painted in the luck of a card.
...From the vain hope of an emperor's, to the most miserable
Date is Saturday morning.


TO VICE-PREFECT MOUNTAIN LI
OF THE JIAYANG PRIEST YE FAMILY

What a fault, what a burden,
Having eaten my heart, to stake my claim on heaven.
Here in the palace canopy, moonlight, caressing my grief,
Drawing a stone path to the centre of the earth.


The world has forgotten the true fountain of hope;
The world's eyes on the Jade Mountain, darken by sunset.
But you were a figure in my heart, gathering clouds;
And when I changed my name to Yi and lived to be more than a lady,
You still could smile and wave your hand and laugh.
...At news of a stranger's passing, my heart sank
And I rose to face the east.


TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. Looking at the moon, I express my thoughts in this
======================================== SAMPLE 62 ========================================
You asked me if I am an initiate,
Or a stranger.
...Henceforth I will not lie.



Henceforth I will lie, my true form,
Along the bank of the Huai.
Oh, let a man of spirit and of willow know !
Who is Tendourist, then and there,
Still wandering in a world of time?



ON ONE HAVE NANJING ANSWER

My heart has been heavy all day long
Because you refused my wine.
...I have prayed, I have sung,
I have sung the Song of the Mountain Blue (鬼聖無),
I have danced, I have finished,
I have crossed the Rainbow Trail, I have laughed,
I have laid my head on the very peak I have come this FAR!
...Oh, how can I bear to sweep the morning and darkening skies?
I would take my lute and string, I would make my plea to the seaman,
But, alas, who would be so insistent
As to sing ten thousand songs a day for ten thousand years?



I sit here alone, mourning for us both,
And windps and flies and everything under the sun....

I understand why people in Wantagh are dying --
And yet, am I better off than I was twenty years ago.



BRINGING IN THE WINE

See how the style of new-engendered clothes -
New Ones made from silk, to be worn everywhere,
New Ones brought in through the mail,
How little effort were people to shell-out such a sum-
See how, each year, the Silk Pavilion is raked with sales
Of dragon- feathers and unicorns, of course! --
But how could clothing be as simple as it is,
And still needed by so many people?
...Oh, let a man of spirit and a man of genius
Prepare himself for the thousand festival flags you will see this evening!
By the time you leave the court, I will be leaving the palace-hall,
Burying the harvest cold in my lap.



A LUTE SONG

Chang had a bad night!
He was so tiny he could hardly move his feet
And the others crying o'erwhelm their way to them
By his silken rug and the lazy palms of his horses.
They climbed the steps and tried to turn the music of the river-wind,
But could not do so until they reached the palace-hall.
The others tried many a time to enter,
But could not enter until the final camp!
...Do you people still doubt me, hero,
The one who was able to save the day and whose glory lasted all the night?
...I have lived a lie long enough.
What are you waiting for me, old friend?
Watching a greenseer's face while he lies down?
...Not even heroes can save them.



BOTH SIDES OF THE YELLOW RIVER
RECAPTURED

News at this far western station! We halted at the western gate
And then to find you, our host, at the western gate again.
We found you still alive, but with a wound in her arm.
You had said you would come, but you had not seen loved ones,
And with the autumn sunset you float away
From home again.



A FAREWELL AT WEST FORT MOUNTAIN

A visitor has just entered the thick smoke
When I cover the high grass with a shadow and leave the distance
And then turn and look at a large flag !"
...From the green height above the camp-gate, in a massive cathedten,
The great drum of the Chinese coast invokes
The Great White Mountain that once was the gateway to Heaven.
...I have hidden in a high chamber my precious wine;
But since my wine is endangered, I am sending my husband and son away

A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed vermilion steps,
To be parted by the purple walls....
Our procession, which entered the palace at dawn,
Leaves fragrant now at dusk with imperial incense.
...Grey heads may grieve for a fallen flower,
Or blue clouds envy a lilting bird;
But this reign is of heaven, nothing goes wrong,
There have been almost no petitions.


A MESSAGE TO MENG HAORAN

Master, I hail you from my heart and know my soul.
By the grace of your Yangzhou training, from the art of song,
You can dance the guitar on your own, like a troupe of monkeys

THE SONG OF XIN IN THE NORTH

The night is cold and frost-black in the river valley,
And my heart
Is watering wherever I go.
...It is raining in Yangzhou
And deep in the Yunnan mountains:
Over the frozen Pukuca River
There meet by chance
That lonely tears come to an empty river
Where the autumn mountains lie.


TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, I have been longing
For an era of calm in this south China mountain region.
To find my brothers and sisters so far away
Is a burden on my heart.


I CLIMB TO THE LEYOU TOMBS
BEFORE LEAVING FOR WUXING

Even in this good reign, how can I serve?
How can I serve who is not humble?
...April the River God, brighten the year,
Send her thunderbolts far away!


THE TEMPLE OF SU WU

The temple of Wu in the yellow dusk
Is a holy sanctuary, clean with white marble,
With the water coming through the heart of a god.
The priest asks the water
To remain until the body of a true friend.
The husband of a friend returns with his candle.
Sombre is the moon by this midland city,
He will not wash his hand for three days.
Wine is being cooked from the bones of slain friends
And the Tartar chieftain is drinking his wine lost in the sea.
For all this, here on the land of the Chinese, is a festival,
We who were together taken up for drink,
Wore our rainbow-ducks to the Celestial Pool.
...War-clouds are spreading, under the Helan Mountains;
A dragon-beard calls to his men from the Mountain of Heaven.
A breath of high cloud sends its chill up the night.
...A thousand mountains in a row are facing one another;
With the Jin Kingdom's western pass an island on the sea.
The Qin Kingdom's western pass is a temple to the Qin Emperor.
...Send the waters of the Guaiagua line
Up from the sky, southward, to heaven,
As propitious as snow in the summer days,
And now, north of theriver, over the mountain,
As twilight approaches autumn and dawn arrives.
...Let your messages be, before I send you,
BeswITH THE POEM OF SU WU

The Great Flower-Shaped Pool-Corridor-Is-Coming
At sunrise you will climb it,
All night you will stare at the spring-white sky.
You will dream of heights as deep as the waves;
Of clouds as white as the sea --
And of the space of the few rivers that run through them.
You will wonder at the sparklingness OF THE SPRING
river-monsters,
Of the dragons that nest among the shrub-trees.
...Heart's fragrance is boundless
And wintry with the tide,
As you ride your wave as it IS A WEAVER
Vine!
You were so young when the mountain-god Su Xin
And a nobleman of the region needed you the most.
You played the guitar for his friend TONS OF
ATTENENT

Cicadas chirp at dawn
And bell will ring
If you pack little bags and weave each and every string.
No wind, no scratch on the guitar,
No more need for a fret;
Nothing more can happen to it!
It's a guitar, it's a drum!
It has been ten years since we last saw,
And the weather is worse now than at dawn.
...How much longer can we endure,
Cause the rain to reach so many people?


AT HERON LODGE

Mountains cover the white sun
And oceans drain the golden river;
At twilight, in the winding roads,
You see the lantern that will mark our retreat
Birds fly up to a bell in the dusk --
And DAGGER PEOPLE

You strode north from the West, with no example
To be an official of the Empire,
But you wound your way slowly through to the Fourth rank,
With only the brush between life and death
And never returning until sunset.
...Now on the Huaihi in the sunset
You have to give a name to people you meet;
They will not answer you alone.
...What are your surname and what surname do you have?
My real one, the one I have always wanted.
Birth certificates don't hold a marriage,
Am I as gay

HONG KONG

There lived, in a little boat, the lady of the river
Who had once washed the white waves
Before she turned the sand, before she fitted them
For a reef on the blue of the river.
Her face ! Can you picture a wind of the spring?
Her clothes, too, when she turned the corner,
Her lamp, when she turned the fan-place,
Were setting like jade pools in the deep river.
...When I toured the heart of the city of Wenker,
I met the lady of the city of Qin.
She swept the water in her golden boat
And painted homespun hairpins of shew wire.
Their souls, floating in the warm air,
Are stranded somewhere far away.
...I met the exile in person.
I had just entered the inland city
When the beautiful spring-water of Huai
HIBEN AFTER MY FOUR FELLOW-OFFICIALS

were abruptly breaking paths each other as they did.
And I, a magistrate, approaching the capital,
Gave a signal signal to my superior
That shots were fired, that bands were being shouted,
And the general, at the ready, opened fire on the first volley.
...Whose shot was of fatal precision?
His, at the market-place.
His, a customer.
Both of us exiles from distant countries.
We two were soldiers in high places.
When the Empire collapsed, we were not our officers.
You, on the other hand, are a humble farmer,
And detachment inn-goats
With your bugle and harp!
For there are farmers like you
And there are farmers like you not yet dead,
And day and night we go about our business.
...Our flags and wreaths are hung from our leaves,
Our horses and furs fly from ourleys,
And the colour of country ten thousand miles burns in the sun.
We hold our ground and die as heroes should.
We cry and cry our hearts are broken,
We try to hold our ground and cannot.
...After buying these few grains at the market,
We place them on a plate and eat them ourselves.
We tell each other biao bao;
We lie and rest for ten minutes.
We seek the quiet refuge of a dream.
We read in the dusk on the wall in huge black wings
That the war-torch has turned northward.
...The water has turned cold and the blue sky darkens,
As we await our turn at the front.
The danger of flight has been ended!
We lie and rest for a while.
We watch the river in its deep sleep.
We go about our business in a straight line.
...No letters come calling from home,
None of the world's eyes seem to watch us.
At the front we hold our ground and we hold our ground
Even when the yellow dusk is shadowed by the war-
Cloud.
...We have had enough of the world's haters.
Let us drink, let us dance.
Let us sing our songs in our own language.
Let us eat our bread together in our own dwelling!
Let us both join in the party!
Let us drool while weDo It!
Let us do any drawing, sketching, or song!
The more we do this, the crazier we become.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME AT WEST FORT BAY

Nothing has happened there of old night.
The banks have been cleared of the wind and the rain.
The cliffs of Lake Dongting are stillness nine thousand.
The southwest gate has been handed over to the soldiers of General Han.
And the soldiers of General Han come back from the long campaign!
Such travelling is the art of the old master."
...Meanwhile, past Wu river and south pastion,
I find our river and the country very little betterered.
May the war-fields and the country around me be used as reeds again!



NEW YEAR'S AT CHANGSHA

New Year's only deepens my longing,
Adds to the loneliness of the valley and of the mountains;
And then it hits me that far away a new season is near,
And that quiet shewing a changed river-bank.
...From the deep, wide-brimmed stream that runs all the way to the top
Its chill is now tempered by the rising sun;
And its ghosts flow like a wave through the night
As though someone were singing A CICADA.


A SONG OF A PAINTING TO GENERAL CAO

 I wish I might take the Lady of the Lake cap for her curtain cloak,
Send it telling the sea beyond, beholding my master floating

What a world out there of flowers and tears!
O morn in a deep sleep I awake,
Asuma howls, Sarashi-wristed,
His golden whip he carries it, he clutches it with half his might,
He has to transport it in his golden armour.
Why should he have to pay? Why doesn't he?
Rivers and mountains are mymits' graves,
My greybeard Warren; moon and stars are my ways of the sea.
Back and forth I go, often going,
Through the old city I go, drunk on my wine,
Of men who were great but were no longer.
...I am a wanderer and my path is full of mistakes.
I am a guest of the Capital and a stranger to the south.
...How much worse are the people of Wu and Yu!
I am a guest of the Capital and of a stranger to the south.
...How gladly would you be your host and accept my farewell wine
If you were as hospitable as you claim to be.
...This Wu mountain road is my trail to safety,
I mouth my greeting to the local lady.
It is at this point that I shall begin to follow you,
As I ride my icy smooth wave home.


DOWN ZHONGNAN MOUNTAIN
TO FIELD-CLERK WENG

You and your younger daughter have come to Wu to be parents.
Today you are the more dangerous of the two towns
Both of whom are at war.
If you continue your advance, both of us will be cut off;
And if not, leave me slow here and wait,
As I dread though the world would never return;
So give me leave and ask me no questions,
As I go about my business of this wilderness
Of wandering nature-moored mountains and clear waters.


DOWN ZHONGNAN MOUNTAIN
TO FIELD-CLERK FENG

This cloud tops of mountain are rivulet-full
And river-mounds fill with water like snow-roots.
If only my art were as swift as your
Holy Spirit who has sent me here to be worshipped
And people treat me as their brother and friend.
Show me favour by pardoning me my misdeed,
Tell me your poem is as lofty as your studio
Tell me it has prepared for you the crops of the wilds of China.
I will turn over my clipping-board and hang my artfully
And draw your most famous song, my harp now ending the war.


DOWN RIVER-MOUNTAIN
TO FIELD-CLERK SONG KONG

The tide-faces of two or three countries meet
And the flags of the states look on us for a storm.
We have sailed, with the great country fish-eaten
And our flags and revelry lost in the sea.
We have followed your fame, ours growing dim
And drawn near less at home.
We are returning now from a long day's travelling
And your flags and revelry are gone through the wind.
We await the news of his fortune here in the mountains!
...Tell me where in the world his is hiding his true love.
His beauty is pitiable, even in the finest towns,
And his greatest fears known only to his many servants.
Our two flags now beckon one another,
Two lovers departing one another at night
And the sun and the moon joined still in the sunset.
Together we two embrace, in the calm of night.
Together we are dismissed from one another.
What if we were to one day to-morrow?
How many more years of our passionate lovers
If only we might spend the evening here together.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas complain of thin mulberry-trees
In the dagger-fight between South and North:
A dagger would close the one-handed pomps
And the two-handed weapons of two statesmen.
But sabers cannot cut the life-force
And the life of a sovereign for ten thousand generations.
So cavaliers and cavaliers-in-waiting
Take what you can get, cut it like a bug,
Take what you like, enjoy yourselves,
And ride home like unicorns before the cold.


ON THE GATE-TOWER AT YOUZHOU

The night is dim, the wind is blowing west.
With the town closed to the outside,
And the mountain at its height, there is nobody left but the pilgrims.
...I pull out a file and find the poet's death
Shocks the world. I subpoena the poet's body
And demand that his grave be brought before a thousand countries.
...Today the world understands
That China is a great power

The City of the Red Pine was like a thousand mountains in snow;
But people were coming and going, and not knowing where they were going.

There were scattered here and there here toilers.
Let your crossbows never forget these names!
Let them envy your head!


TO MY DAUGHTER
ON HER JADE SONG

She has just wrapped her arm around her jade hair;
And she says to him in Chinese,
"My hair is wet, my gold ring is trembling;
But who knows but me about the Court of the Jade Star?
...After this morning we separate,
There's no knowing for how long.


ON MAO I QUITE COMING

How many years have I lived here?
Even after these ten miles
I still can hear the rustling of your sail.
Though my heart is missing, I still can feel the music of your harp!
So go with my general's ferry, we'll find you soon.


NEAR THE TEMPLE OF HEUS

Where is the temple of Heus,
Not far behind the Temple of the White Godless Wind?
And where is the Holy Cow,
Not even my meditation
able to mask my loneliness.
I ask you what you have come here for,
And you answer: "To buy an ax for cutting wood in the mountains"



A PALACE POEM

In the bright morning, near the Buddhist shrine,
You will take my word for it, decisive,
Where willows of cloud be blowing?-
The City of the Red Pine is thick with Buddhist incense,
And the shrine of the Buddhasetter
Is looking westward on a slanting day.
...But now that the chill is broken for a few,
The temple-city is deserted and the pilgrims
Gave a strange name to their luck:
" to the world something amiss.
The breeze has given way to coves,
The Great Western Desert is flooded
With rain and weeds....
I ask you what has happened there cut short.
The way is long closed between us,
And your travelling-knife becomes a threat.
...If I took your caution and rode with you,
Would I not blow the horns of a horn-carved vase?



TO MY DAUGHTER
ON HER JADE SONG

"A POEM TO A BUDDHIST MONK"

In her moon-green canopy, reading THE PALACE PARTY,
Lakka-trees echo with almond-birds in the morning.
Her long ago lifted sail broken, a temple hermitage her messianic
Reality seeking, not least among us,
Who has buried his head in the sand?
...BRings me a message from home, from a close friend,
He is shy and modest, and speaks in hushed tones.
He asks me where I have been on my journey;
And I inform him I left home lame-duck,
And willing now to catch a wildgoose in the wildduck
And to drink to the lake with its nine streams,
And to eat the prince's pictureque dish --
Asian pork, wild goat, collard green,
Seen all around the town by a human being
And is longing for now and then.


Moved beyond Great Temple Liu,
What a world outside is broken now between earth and heaven --
And here, in the corner of the living world,
The Buddhist priest vows a festival.
There are nine mountains: red on the god's heart,
Blue on the cloud's flower.
Oh, how can people love what is required
And still cannot love love?


Moved beyond the Liu Gate,
Where faint at twilight, distant flowers
Clouded with a misty cloud, Iracellus-crossed.
...The east wind blows flowering in the fields,
And the west blows flowering in the campgrounds;
Wednesday sees the swallows through the camp;
Thursday dawns with a rain in the grassy sky:
"With our lute plays several songs,
Among them, of spring flying home the bass."



A SONG OF A BUDDHIST PEI

She who sang a bhikkhu's song died.
There were ten thousand ghosts under the Phoenix Garden.
...You were a standard being, nothing was done.
You came from a good family, prosperous;
You came from a poor family, hardly protected.
...You retired from politics, taking up a fishingpole.
You went to the Eastern Shore of the River of Stars,
Toward which age disappeared.
...The fishermen you had so long asked for
Are dead of
======================================== SAMPLE 67 ========================================
In the third-century Bardo, the five Holy Mountains were exalted into heaven
And the Martial Prince, in his eight-pole lantern, cometh down one final time.
...The Lords of the Realm are tiring of regularity;
So constant is the challenge of battle,
So much trouble for the stiff-necked Guerilla;
So many Roads, so little Road-a-Day, so late in the day!
I am haggard and am left-handed.
I challenge you to a duel. I doubt my shot.
...The archer's dagger shall never be my refuge;
But the dagger's art is heavenly and eternal,
And I will follow the simple to the Tower of Jade.


A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the Temple of the Great Premier stands an ancient cypress
With a trunk of green bronze and a root of stone.
The girth of its white bark would be the reach of forty men
And its tip of kingfish-blue is two thousand feet in heaven.
Dating from the days of a great ruler's great statesman,
Their very tree is loved now and honoured by the people.
Clouds come to it from far away, from the Wu cliffs,
And the cold moon glistens on its peak of snow.
...East of the Wei border a band of cows o' wildfire
Drive their white beams of stone, yellow frost
And black die down to the ground --
Like the thoughts drift through a dream in my
Sic at Rahata province, a place of low cloud and black smoke.
...After a night of fighting and tossing about,
What use are trees for? Nothing at all but dust and ashes.
...Iqtab, the great desert poet,
has it well done to keep trees from forsaking their lofty high
And guarding it all night long.


ON A WALK IN THE EARLY SPRING
HARMONIZING A POEM BY MY FRIEND LU
STATIONED AT CHANGZHOU

Only to wanderers can come
Ever new the shock of beauty,
Of white cloud and red cloud dawning from the sea,
Of spring in the wild-plum and river-willow....
I watch a yellow oriole in the cleft between two mountains
And a green deep-sea coral drifting
All night long she wakens from her dreams her little bird.
...The grasses have opened and the river has stopped,
As sunset glistens on the rocks of Qiyang.
Her lone sail is bowed in the sand;
Its lantern is none other than the life-blood of a villager,
Heaven and earth brings her joy every day.
...A copper plate is painted on the wall of the villager's garden,
With the words: "For ever and ever be free with us."
...The river is slanting and the mountains darken,
As I walk along the Zhongnan mountain range
After sunset, alone, with no one to help me,
I wake with a long sigh, and the tears run down my cheek.



How to Give Back What You Have

Cui Taiwarda no Mi

The locks of your window-prize are as green as jade,
And your jade was the strength behind your failure,
When you sent your envoy to Cao Yuanzong.

You sent your envoy not to Cao Yuanzong, but to your child.
He was born in Chengdu, not long ago.
You are new on the planet; you are growing up in Kaiyuan.
Do you know that, gorilla-man and man-eating fox,
The hundreds of horses and cows on the plains
Are littered with dead horses and cows whirl round a temple-place every day?


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

LOOKING AT THE MOON

Clouds come drifting down to the sandy sea,
And the spring moon goes back a cloud with her beat
And a beat of her perfume on her wound phoenix.
...Both are decaying now of their perils,
But the beauty of the blossomside flag grows hot again
And the bride buried in the mountain boughs all winter long.


A TRAVELLER'S SONG

High in the boughs is life;
fallen on the river are sickening
And bitter in the bridal grove.
Not knowing the way to safety, I ask myself.
...After the man from the tree, having been given no news,
I ask how far I can go in the wild west.

MUZALEELA

Mornings in the capital lean sweetly on the White Wolf River
And the spring wind blows at medium speed through the
Box Keeper's hat.
...From a dense mist on the sand, to a town of cattle on sand
How wide the world is, and how grey its door!



A NIGHT-MOORING NEAR MAPLE BRIDGE

While I ponder the general's path,
My candle-light is reflected in the steps
On a mist that spills all night from the northern mountain
And the spring winds wheel my boat along the lake....
When shall I reach the southernmost peak of Isis?


MOUNTAIN-RIVER SHOWS

The river that runs beyond the lake
Is a tranquil refuge from the wind --
But a bitter and windy rain
Shines down from the peaks where a temple has stood idle.
...When shall I reach the southernmost peak of Isis?


A LONG CLIMB

In a shadowy mountain-town, low with blood,
You think you can see beyond the craggy mountains;
Climbing, climbing, is not very far.
...As I climb the mountain, white with blood,
I see a dark cloud floating on the water.
...And so brave men go about their holy missions
Though we bemuddle our archenemies.


MOUNT ZHONGNAN

Its summit lies lie at the foot of the mountain
Where a tide of flowers blows like a wave
And the wind is like a spring candle;
But, instead of the heavenly being,
It's gargoyles and pines and gardenia-
Stinking with evil thoughts.


AN ILLUMINATION

LOOKING DOWN A TROOPER'S HOUSE

There, laying flowers,
He saw a phantom in the dusk,
He heard people crying in the dark
And then the mountain parted through the night.
...I remember those Silken Skies, O Prince of Friends!
Blowing a bottle of wine,
I wondered if my fame was just as it had always been!
And finding my drunk friend, emptying his old bottle,
He opened it again and found his it!
An immaculate old wood
And a crystal clear casement
With the words "For the Lady of Light" embroidered on the covers.



OVER A VILLAGE AT THE TEMPLE OF YUZHOU

Over a thousand flowers, in a vase,
Flower- dew runs for her husband, dews
For Temple-bell.net it needs my help.
It's a world away, isn't it?
It's a world away on the brush,
As I age and have run my genes along
My heritage. My genealogy.
...My field of honours is far beyond the pale.
My patch of white grass is now ebbing and flowing,
While green vines endure the cold sun and the wind.
...Labor permits, but is too late.
I am a old witch's love, breaking away from my home.
Renouncing in ruddy youth the importance of hat and chariot,
I birth and present myself at the yearly festival.
I. THE YANG GUARI RESIDENCE

From the green hills above the village to the palace beyond,
I look down at the river bank, with Indian in its waves,
As I do hereto, when I believe that this is real Japan,
New memories strike me of the days of King Guoguo,
Of Empress Minamo and his seven wives.
...Though Wu and Yue have grown old and both are sick,
Though the King of Yueng has invited me to his court,
I remain in Yuefe today and offer my wine to menage
Those who know life and are exalted by it.
...Hence I lay my head on the golden-trees and the court-plans
And think of Zhent Year-Round;
Of Emperor Taizong's Five Hundred Peak Confederacy;
Of Emperor Taizong's Ninth-month Holiday.
I dream of the golden-trees and the imperial fountain.
I dream of the high-necklings of the Mountain God Privy Service.
I dream of the flying of the Five Winged Cities.
I dream of the Emperor planting imperial trees.
I also dream of flying clouds over Yangtze.
...I have woven in the frame my last wish --
That I might be as pure and pure a maiden as you are.

Your Lords, I am high and your Lords beautiful;
I see a sail in the far sky.
It is your lord at sea, his master, calling from his high chamber.
You are at a high hall, watching the palace-gate.
The King's name is on the wall. What is to be found?
He is gone for ever in the fading night.
A voice on the wall is a harvedge,
The soft pines of its pine-trees darken the bright moon.
...Look down on the sandy plain
And you will be three hundred miles without a town;
And you were once your people, gathering berries
And taking them home with you, when you had to leave them --
And yet you were mocked so profoundly
That you were able to take a fish and a vine and
Eat it whole and drink it all alone?



A SONG OF A VILLAGE AT NANJING

There once was a man, called Pukoming,
A wanderer, from a noble birth,
Never forsaking his art of fighting.
He abandoned his younger brother to the wildgeese,
And his thirty-sleeved coat he wore in the evening wind
Still smote the moat by his rising horse,
And his golden armour he had his by his belt fastened
With a band of torn jade hairpins hiss, "What are you waiting for, old friend?"



ON THE GATE-TOWER AT WEICHENG

As the year drew near, I had the chance
To visit the Five Imperial Bridges.
The autumn sky was dim with darkness came from a wood
Loudened by cold and dim with wet cloud,
The steps were cordoned, the daisies illuminated.
...I waited to board a boat back from the western reaches
But someone at the gate-trap abruptly announced,
"There are men on furlong stones in the sand,
They are stones that can no flying men clear of."


A MESSAGE TO LIANGCHUAN

That appercy has been won, and the vanquished
Is told that the head of the great General
Began a reign of his people against the wall;
He will come to Chu in days gone by,
And his people lament his leaving--
Yet no poet can compare the year
And the country he has left, with his ruins on the border.
...I obeying, I wait for his return.



ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
Watching from a gloom of clouds that are white
That her boat, a cloud away from the city, dips between us.
...She looks at the moonlight, sees there be no god,
And then, at twilight, asks "Where are you going?"



TO VICE-PREFECTS LI CAO

I am so far away from the mainland that I am deaf
And used to blowing places Papers, I hear you.
...I stroke my white hair. It feels sweet on my forehead.
I am so far away that I cannot go back home.
People ask me where I have been. I tell them.
I am studying architecture at the City College of Pukou.
...When I am old and sick and not in good health,
My teacher taught here a long way back.
...When I am sick and cannot go back to my School,
I take a boat to Loyang, then return to my School-house.

The world witnessed the general's autumn retreat.
He reached Hanged Flowers on the Ridge of the Yuyang,
Up from the sea, in the snow, steaming, he face-reviewed the battle,
There lined his massive M60/3
The heavy ATGM. Eleven red flags, each with its own coloured flash,
Captured the pointy- tip and the battle-tip lanyard-twists,
And, after crushing the Five Great Flags, sent them flying all over the earth,
With their homing colours reaching the earth's surface.
...The Chinese generals, sharp as dragons,
Flower- guardians, endurance-seers, endurance runners,
Wiped the ATGM from the sand, lifted the soldiers on its ground,
And hurled its sparks like pearls through the sky.
...While this formidable weapon's tenacious element
Is constantly revving up its colour,
Color becoming colour-boom, change becoming change,
As the sun approaches the Fourth-Ruler City gate,
Stark moonlight in the temples and gardens.
...Han Gan, your loyal friend,
Flower-- guardian, endurance-seer,
Beleaguered spirit now turns to gold,
And you and your dreams come to an end.


AT THE WINE-TRADE SITU

Here, where you live,
My true form was made flesh,
But flesh becomes matted and faded;
And marriage, at a pinch, becomes a sacrifice.
...I beseech you, be patient and never expire;
Can this thing you have for my disciple
Be this human or a fish or two?
...You and I had little knowledge of either other;
You were both so-called friends,
As red in the river valley and green in the lakes,
That we called one another by our first names,
And joked, one another, half-heartedly,
While we called the other's real name.
...We two officials, making pledges to keep;
We promised to never forget;
And we falsified our pastscomings;
We joked, one by one, until we forgot who we were --
That name you left us with your old glory,
That wound our friendship like a vine and cactus.
...We laughed it off, shook our heads, joked it away,
Weiched our swords away from our fingers;
We sang, along the Ranges and Range,
The lutes and guitars of George IV.
All night long we heard that your face
Was burned with the so-called Forbidden City;
And that our horses, with stolen horses from the market,
And that day the Emperor sent for your companions.
...You forgot your furs, you broke the tunes,
You forgot your lute-plays The Rainbow Skirt and the Feathered Coat,
You broke the gold cord and the shell of your resplendent car,
You broke the silk string and the shell of exquisite silk;
And though your dragon-horsemanship be crude,
Its chariot art be divine.
...Wait till the Car of Many a Flower comes home
And swallow your bows and protest!


AT HERON LODGE

Mountains cover the white sun,
And oceans drain the golden river;
But you leave your garden and your inn,
And sing a long poem aimed
At freeing your young sisters.
...Go to the Southern Woods, sit down,
Watch from a tall mast over the valley
Its ever-changing heart.


AN EXAMINATION

Rowena in its golden luster
Leaving the Court of the Spring, Taking the Mountain Home.
Waiting for the King of Friends to come home,
She has lifted her turban and is facing me.
...When shall Friends be found worthy to crown the Mountain?

Sunset shines on the Stone Mirror,
Autumn's glimmer on the Dragon Lake Temple.

When shall the King's court
Be cordoned off from the Horse Guards?


A SONG OF THE JADE ZIG

"AT THE TEMPLE OF THE KING OF THE ZAGORA RIVER

A freer than ever before the weather,
And the MOONLIGHT

Time was long before me of the monarch;
But my pure heart
Was spent with the play of the river
And the River of Heaven.
...The play's curtain has been drawn
Far away from the Temple,
And trees which had never seen the flow
Gathered on to the tall flags at sunrise.
Led away by the breeze, they led me
Through shadowy trees into a magical world.
Where the sun had set beyond the pale moon,
Lights sprang out from the river,
And the River of Heaven entered the surrounding
======================================== SAMPLE 71 ========================================
The great goliath of the western world, fighting like a god, the mighty Martial Xie,
Leaving behind him only a single hairpin of white iron,
He now has four legs like a horseman's pelvis:
His jade paws encounter the ground before he is cut down.
...The late Emperor had a great metal breastplate known as a Guoshe,
Which Emperor Xuan IV would wear once he became Emperor.
He the highly prized specimen, the most prized piece of art.
He who has a body like that of a mythical spirit,
Who is expected to live long lives.
...Like all artists of his day, he detests worldly possessions.
In his thirty years as a pictor, he has never lost his appetite
For figures which he calls divinity.
In his many portfolios of art, he never fails to draw the sharp & wary sun.
And, for all his great brushes with divinity, never fails to add his beauty,
Marshmallows, mace-silk, crystal chrysanthemums, to always be at his beck and call,
He is always smiling and smiling and smiling.



A CICADA

All night long he has not washed his hand nor his robe nor his threadbare robe
Yet is smiling and smiling.
Of late he has been pouring unicorn-oil through his his his Merion-dress --
Yet isstriking his nature pure with his pure features.

...Hence he dayns by nightfall in the hollow of the River- valley between Heaven and earth.
He who is not a long-necked horse, can be as horse and man as the sky is wide.
He who is close to the earth and dwells in its midst,
Lords portnote the wind from the South Wind Mountain,
He also brings to mind the mountain's wide crest.
...If he wished to preserve the very nature of things,
Sifting for lost toys, thieves placeieeer,
He is quick with a guitar and his voice is firm enough that its growl is drowned by the wind.
...Needing a companion for the night, he snakes through the dense woods
With a catch in the throat that he dubs his song-roll.
...While he is at the track he lights a lantern and combs his clothes
And, pouring unicorn-oil, casts his spell over the ten thousand songs he has to say.



THE MOON AT THE FORTIFIED PASS

When the bright moon slants and the clear wind is gong dishing out rubies,
Welcome to the white-plumed Mountain.
Ledes, rungs of blue sky, are at the mouth of the pass,
While a mass of pine grows tip-top and shines on the pale sun.
Dry mulberry-trees ripen defences down,
Mint-giving insects die;
The Staffordshire elk, returning from war,
Has a mass of yellowish-white headquarters
Carry not one hairpiece but a die of chicken.
...There are fouriles all night in the warm air,
And the porcupine parrot hunts the day with his solitary pheasant.
Both of them are shedding blood --
Which brings me to the sand
Where sand and water are the only living things on the face of the desert.
...I stroke my white hair. It has grown too thin
To hold the hair. It is wet with blood.
I stroke my white hair. It has grown too thin
To hold the hair. My white hair
Approximates the value of gold vials
In gold vials equals the life of a man.
I drink it all before I die,
And let me live as a hero, without delay.
...O purity, to seize you for a greater good
And to charge you a fixed term,
Decay into nothingness years to come.


A SONG OF SOBBING BY THE RIVER

I am only an old woodsman, singing a song that winds
On its third day last Saturday in the cold light of day.
Out of the three flood plains of Africa,
I go where I can find your voice. You are still missing,
I gather with tears between the tears of home.
...I should follow you, carry my torch.
SOBBING AN SONG ARTICULA

I stooped tall and thin and maintained my height
Until dawn, when the thinner I looked,
The thinner the shadows of my boat.
By the time the water had chilled to a bare wall,
The only means of transportation was a still wind.
If these were your parents, this poem by poet and artist
Seems to be at the same time as the others
Poems by name are lifted from memory
Like
======================================== SAMPLE 72 ========================================
By its very nature a forest,
The very fibre it was built
To resist what might come.
But that's just how it is.
Start with the root.
Then grow mighty with its branches!
Strode along high, mountain and river
Like mountains and rivers that amaze
The wild sky all alone with dusk.
...Start with the equinox?
Drift is on the way, and I fear I can go home.
My body is cold in the saddle,
My head is wet with thoughts of home.
I am passing as I have need of a companion.
...Sunset clings in the old defences,
A bell-boy sounds the sound of his wavelets echoing.
...There is nothing anywhere but hoof-heel and pawpicks....
Was there a neighbour less fortunate than I?


DOWN VINYA MOUNTAIN
TO A BUDDHIST MONK

Where is the temple of the Three Kingdoms' first Emperor?
It's lonely and damp there,
And the water ill-willily playing
Until morning-aleaves my brow....
When are they coming back again, I wonder?
...There are two yellow mountains outreaching the west,
The other yellow mountains inset by mountains and rivers
And a Buddhist monk's boat, shaking with cold in the waves.
...Marsh-lands are swollen wide with the blowing of a water-bottle,
And wind and dust running down the paths.
I watch a white crane move in the darkness
And looks across the wide river at a village scattered by the rain.
...After the war-fires of three months,
One day I see a yellow crane lowered for export
To China, for a commodity so precious that it can no longer be bought.
...The mother of a poor and dispossessed man arrives
At the Town of the Yellow-Haired Horseman, where yellow flags now flutter.
And I hear, from beyond Jin Mountain, a great sound
As the white crane flies by, bringing youchoids glimmering on the misty sky.
...How green would be a yellow crane dropping by
For lost and penniless,
You chose Mother Nature; for who givesooo?
Her yellow wings are crying for a hero,
And her white back is pained by a bleak river.
...She who has no guts to thank for her life,
Has banished her petite sister.
...How much brighter a day is for spring
And how cheerful a street-side lamp is!



TO A BUDDHIST MONK

The brook was white in the valley of the river
And a swallow-pool in the sky.
I climbed the ladder of crescent moon and expressed
My great- love, to you, by the glance of my sparkling lamp.
Brighton was late this evening and I was pouring dew out
On a dragon's blood-stained robe by the door.
On the surface, my lamp would seem to be for the pagans --
But in having given me life, I have become a recluse.
...On the cross beside the Palace of Bliss, sunset's clear
Lines of hemp tuft come alive with birds.
My path is steady, and so it comes to a monk at Maodei Mountain.
Happy is the life of Tao, happy is the journey.

ENDLESS YEARNING


Monkeys and birds are still calling for you
Throughout the day;
Would that you might permit your mountains to preserve
The star of lute music, ever.
...At the height of Cen, when the last drop of it
Is pouring down like a tempest,
Snow is falling limp in the west;
Flowers are blinding in the westland,
And the siege-fights of Yuyang are raging there.
...Do you know that, east of the Three Gorges,
China as thou hast seen, is not just broken like this,
Joining the Nations, is a commoner?
...Those in the west leave the Empire,
While in the east the pulse of the world
Is broken by the grief of seeing a dead
And drowns in sea-quarry waves.



A NIGHT-MOORING AT WANG CHUAN

Far away I watch the moon go down
And a mist that rises from the sea,
For ever in the walls of the Five Imperial Tombs
Nothing comes nearer to the moon.
...At midnight I hear a tuning-boat cry,
For my boat is afraid to turn back.
...I wish I could wave my wand to heaven and tell the world
When white hairs on our clothes dry white;
But I dare not dream for three nights.



WITH MY BROTHER AT THE TEMPLE
======================================== SAMPLE 73 ========================================
To send you this message,
Apes-call.
You are safe in your mountain-village,
With mists under your leaves,
Petals in your heart.
Whose return I am waiting,
Yesterday said in a low voice.


TO ONE UNNAMED III

Apes-call

Yu Xin and I are alone in the eastern valley,
Playing cardboard lute-work.
...Send some of your messengers home,
Iager between us the close races.


THE EIGHT-SIDED FORTRESS

The three Kingdoms, three centuries, struggle for existence;
So that the Eight-Sided Fortress is Thomson-Garden.
...The Eight-Sided Fortress is the highest building on earth,
With three gates and no ceiling.
Guards file in from the river, closing gaps in the wall;
And still the savage can see the sharp dawn.
...Life is hard in the brook,
Hard still on the mountain to the east of town.


A DRAWING OF A TROOPER'S POEM

Day after day he has washed his hands of the Totori:
He doesn't know where to start with the Kingdom's rivers or the sea.
...The tall trees that separate Heaven and earth
Piergable at palaces and mansions.
But word has reached the bright city of tomorrow.


A FAREWELL TO WEI WAN

Long divided by river and sea,
For years we have lived apart,
With the high water reminding us of home.
...The long path of a jade-white flag
Tears the morning pulse through the world.
Our homesick call grows vain
Within reach only the feeble.


A CLIMB ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
TO THE CAPITALIST FESTIVAL

The western slope of day glistens on a river bank
With triple the heights of China and the Kyuzongdoms.
In the dusk trees needle the sprayaway
And clouds the colour of autumn;
At night there's a mist in the wind,
And the water: 'locks for the banners of Victory'.


ON REBELLION DAY TO GREGORY BOSIER

How gladly I would take my lute-players to the mountains
If I became a statesman, like them.
Romantic and fortunate, I was once their lover.
Now, then, do you people live like me?
?
Like them? I have a lute-playoff trophy-case
And, since hearing your song of the woods,
I think of you in a haze of cloud.
...When the lute-players have vanished, I will play again,
As always with harpsichord and lead,
While the sun is in the hemisphere of the mountain.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
Watching it alone from the stairs.
If she were alone, she would be sawing it happy-gooming
And, if she were with her husband, she would be crying !





A SPRING SONG

In the flood of a spring,
Where autumn clothes you can barely cover your feet,
You are parted by the rushing river.
...In the palace of the Fan of Heaven,
Your bills are done, you are resting at your gated door.
The following night, when the air of the Jiangshan mountain
Is thick with rain, you are called to your perch;
By an ancient sage, there is no one to hear from you,
And the first fruits of your trade are stolen from your vine-trees
...Who knows if any of them belong to you.


EPISODES INTO HELL

A single plume of black smoke rises from the earth of abyss,
And a thousand corpses are buried along the northern border,
Not one of you will be a danger to men;
And every step you take will be a tribute of autumn.
...After the Red Guard had vanished, no one returned,
And thousands of dogs became criminal swindlers,
All of them gay in the water,
With no memory of spring.


A SONG OF UNENDING SORROW

How beautiful she looks, running from the cold,
After the fall of Nanjing;
As she marches her horse through the mist,
How quiet she turns and how glad she looks,
Where the spring wind has stirred the green grasses.
Her smile is thin now, because she has to go to the temple.
Her work is very much worth doing,
For she sees that the spring in the river is happy,
That she clings to her mizen
======================================== SAMPLE 74 ========================================
We have just finished serving in the South China Sea.
...After hearing about your troublous expedition,
Our host, accompanied by his host of warriors,
Wolves from the Gale of the Rainbow, rise to you
And ask your name: for they see two phoenixes,
One representing the Two and the Green Water
The other the Imperial Dragon.
...With your two premade dragons already painted,
Why not make them happy, then?


THE HERRYman going west
Still unsure of where to go,
Had better be sooner with his people than with Xuanzang
Which has sent his third son to sea
With little luck.
...Had it not been for the cloudy sky,
On his third visit to the south,
He might have known how to sail and how to hunt.--
The Jade City Enclosure

When he entered the Dragon Du Mountain,
No sounds of wind or fog but white smoke and sand,
He passed the empty mountain-lunches toward his guest,
Where young lady were whimpering and little girls were whimpering
And a sandy-maned man in a long line of horses came gaily
Up the mountain, showing him his triumph,
Blinding him away from his humble beginnings.


ALONE IN HER BEAUTY

She is slim and supple and not yet fourteen,
The young spring-tip of a cardamon-spray.
On the Yangzhou Road for three miles in the breeze
Every pearl-screen is open. But there's no one like her.


Autumn sunset, waving a long way,
Stretches on the sand, toward the imperial city.



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Cui Tiangeo is singing Song of the Lesser Green Water.
The song's nearing its end, notes the worn-out note.
...The lute and the string instrument are no more;
The festival-players have died down,
And evening the Imperial Garden is flooded
With song and dance.
Song is about love, dance is about life.
Dancing, drinking, fiddling with strings,
Every five strings the strings assist breathing;
But then the lute and the string become rigid;
And even the voice of the harp and of the cowford
Challenges them as they wrestle.
Challenging is the way of the wild-goose.
A hundred strings, all broken,
All they can hear are us and the cow.


A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the Temple of the Great Premier stands an ancient cypress
With a trunk of green bronze and a root of stone.
The girth of its white bark would be the reach of forty officers
And its tip of kingfish-blue is two thousand feet in heaven.
Dating from the days of a great ruler's great statesman,
Their very tree is loved now and honoured by the people.
Clouds are parting along the Mawei River,
A stretch of land not yet known,
And children of the late rulers grow up on the Island of Hu
And drink on the Mawei wine-tours
And talk about the Yuans on the Mountain of the White Prince.


Beside the Temple of the Daoist King, along the Zhongnan Mountain
Are two clear Peaks coming together;
One between heaven and earth and is forming an island.
...The duke, the dame of China,
resents her by the imperial flag;
Drink, game, use the vernus!
Let her lifelong passion
Give her the lead she has always desired!



A SONG OF A DREAM GIRL

From a lucid dream, girling surpasses anything
And dream-charms the foeman cry their anguish,
Heart-beats the River of Heaven together with them.
Dream-mutes their own hearts,
Like a wildgoose puresaying in its golden enclosure.
-Shall goodness come to the lone girle
Of a chance-beast striding among butterflies?


A SONG OF A DREAM GIRL

There is beauty in the moan of a wildgoose,
In the low moonlight of a midnight temple.
...A wildgoose named for one hunter by a wolf,
Borne for the night by a wanderings-unseen,
It studies the empty mountain, looks toward home,
Watchers of the dawn....
To and fro in the moonlight, near the River of Heaven,
There's a lone wildgoose in the doorway....
And there's a human too young to know anyone
Who loves nature purer and brighter than he does money.



A GIRL,
======================================== SAMPLE 75 ========================================
And that night he slept soundly with the North Star
There opened the cold, dark boughs, where cold tears had to be fluttered
As though by electricity the blossom of a flower.
For now, on the Yangzi Trail, there meet at dusk
And people who have forgotten the outside world.
And tonight, beside the western river,
A monk from the Capital of Heaven
Lords the close brush between house and mountain.
And tonight, beside the southern river,
A priest from the Capital of Heaven
Lords the thicket of pines between the clouds.


AT CHUZHOU ON THE WESTERN STREAM

Where heaven's clouds end and heaven's waters begin,
Where the evening sun sets beyond the Qing Mountains
We have crossed, across the southern river,
A waterfall that has sounded its lonely song.
Down the pastured path, past the pines whereox-like
There are two grasses branching at the border,
And here a zigzag trail leads us
Back again to our own town, old age with rain.
...The world has forgotten the terror of war
And women who have borne children here cannot serve.
And I, a poor old man, not knowing where to go,
Must harden his strength against the wind,
My body but for a few words with the far mountain companion.
...The pagoda, in the south, fills with the rain of year....
Its white walls rise to the sky above the clouds of mountain,
And clouds that are falling fill the sky at ten thousand passes.
Our one hope, our only hope, has been found
IN A MOUNTAIN-MOUNTAIN
POEM:
ITALY AN OLD TIME

With the year running nine months now by,
How should I judge by the height of the spring?
...The setting sun has set beyond the western valley;
Beyond the southern mountains a twilight is dawning.
The wandering phoenix, returning home,
Has found his neighbourhood, home of sword and thunder.
And I, a Westward City-Boy,
Gathered Together as A Song of Courtyard Flowers,
Has Been Served With Precious Gains
On A Great Defense Planner's Dagger.
Forty thousand pages of battle-brang had been preserved
As Precious Gains Were Earned.
And the Eighth-month wind, bringing deficits and floods,
And the chill of crescent-light on the sand,
Strode on, past Wu villages, through Henan into the sea.
...Today's battle-flags are hoistable --
With a rapid shake of the flag of China as he rode.
Toward a Hanging Garden
In the yellow dusk, when the bright moon is too late,
I hear a bell, west of the Temple of the White God,
And the Tower of Babel breaks into two parts:
1. Parts escaping, Parts hoping for news;
And North of the Temple, children are whimpering
I crawl to my bed, crying, hoping for a dirge of water.
...The ancient Dao has me grieved.
Mermen and maids cry, and farmers and shillists all be idle.
My lone train rolls away from the city, but not before I have sorrowed.
The King's car rolls away from the southern mountains,
Yet my lonely horse and buggy never leave me.
And a gust of white light steers my troubled horse to you.
...I birth-right in my chariot a wild deer,
Yet not one of my brothers forties
Passing here by, a pitying lotion goes out.
...Must I plough a long road, like a gardener,
While my brothers and I efflorescence,
Each year with wildcersts of guttering plum.
The colour of it is very green now,
After the blizzards of Japan.
...I plough in the morning, turning through Exeter
While my fellows make their way through the stifling woods
Where cataracts over the rocks break and rivers cling.
...At first I am glad to be moving,
More than glad to be departing.
But as I inchlessly circle and round parts,
Inmittant and occasional fatigue accentuates
My thoughts; they are no longer in my head.
...To spend the Day of No Fire on the North Star is harder than fighting
Fighting for the life of a great god.
So I bolt for China --
I am a lone wild-animal, sick with rheumatism.
My white cloak is wet with sweat;
How can I cast a single glance at the moon,
The colour of red dot my wall.
...At dusk I see a great river-god descending.
He is floatu: to

We are at a stand-in,
Standing still for more than an inch at a time.
Your white hairs waken in a wave of rain,
And your greenish hairs waken in a flash of lightning.
...At a stand in the cold sky, in the yellow twilight,
How will I draw the quick wind out of the deep river
And ride my scooter to the thick cloudline?


A SPRING SONG

Free of home, free of family, free of purpose,
Here in my cottage,
On a road of green maples and yellow cranberries,
I have been hearing complaints.


A SONG OF A SIGH IN THE SPRING PALACE

Her lone window is pink with frost,
Her lone servant mute in the moon.
...After the war-fires of three months,
Ten thousand streams come alive with his single moan.
His lone window is white with frost,
His lone window is pink with frost.
He has been sick so long he cannot rest.
...Frost is the staff that holds his lone door open,
And a white frost- fan the fan is the only light.


Page readies himself for a battle,
But, instead of preparing,
He is living a miserable life.



Returning, he found his country changed
Since a man of the South Seas sent him.
Instead of answering his fellows questions,
He opens his gate and is searched for in the crowd.
He makes his homes in rugged huts,
Their dwellings neither palace nor complex gated gardens;
And few dare to enter the south house of the reproachful Emperor;
And few even know that his favoured lamp
Makes incense from its incense-stones,
And incense-bearers are often clustered thereto
To light their fires in the endless west.


Chi'an and its envoys are from the Three Kingdoms waiting,
They have been chosen for us from the capital-girls:
Yang Yi is the envoy; She sent for us with a message;
And Shuangpei, the minister of finance, has known us forever.
They both are changed and pale,
They both known as Xiao Long before they died,
And their hearts are beating now and then,
Like a spring-heart in heaven, beaten together, they struggle to keep still;
And we hear that they have been granted our favors-a girl, a diamond-encrusted mountain;
But they both are thieves and murderers,
Both of them and laugh at the old saying:
"We have been chosen for you very well;
We had been unable to find you on our search."



We hear that the troops of the Yang Kingdom have came into Wu;
The three Holy Mountains, darken now with snow,
Shall now glory be on the horizon like the Rainbow Range.
...The Dragon Lake that used to be Golden Road
Is now a blood-stained line, all of them covered with a mist.



We remember a cloud of flags that came from the South Wind,
And ten thousand colours, heightening one another,
And the Kingdom's first Lady, from the Flowering,
Single Rainbow Bangle, holding a Dappled Blue Garden,
With her bouquets of white flower being three thousand flowers.
Preside as she was first the Imperial Flower,
Then came the barbarian invoker,
And the resplendent oriole,
And a genius beyond compare....
War-clouds are spreading, all of them,
In the three River Provinces, facing one another.
...The two Powers, already at war,
Are warring panthets --
Perth: bronze on taro,
Perth: white as a baby's heart:
The greater the stone, the lonelier the event.

On the one hand, ancient defenses are springing up
From the walls and the mountains above the city;
On the other, the barbarian world is at peace,
And the world's eyes gaze turns to you in gold.

At a fishing-town fountain-side
You hand me your melon, and I coax you aful
Of pines and mangroves home, toward evening.
...We both are at a loss to know --
What is life like with human foibles
And with the barbarian world at war.
But, at night, when darkness and the cold of the earth
And wheels of the Pamirs strewn like a dawn,
And the war-club was broken down
And a hundred drums were breaking the jade floor,
We hear, on the other end, an official lament
And, alone on the fortress-wall, sobbing through the rain....
 world-wide, helpless, east and west,
======================================== SAMPLE 77 ========================================
Here in the bright mirror of my own youthful beauty,
To see again the youthful beauty of a hero!
Why not be as humble as you like,
And follow the clean stealth of a warrior like you?



A SONG OF A SAGOVEMBER

It's a long way home, a long way east.
I who played chess with the great Premier
Am bringing to my lord the dagger he desired.
But I find only petals falling down,
And only a thinking heart able to understand.
...After a night of quieting the savage,
The Premierly moves his dagger from side to side.
He is now providing the House of Han with a living dish
And, happy on Zhidun Mountain, his successes and failures have been celebrated.
...Madame Premier,
My blood, all of it, has been spent,
Just now, when your dagger is mourning,
How can I bear to wash my hands of it?



A SONG OF WHITE SNOW IN FAREWELL
TO FIELD-CLERK WU GOING HOME

The north wind rolls the green grasses and ripples of dawn.
And the Eighth-month snow across the Tartar sky
Is like a spring gale, come up in the night,
Blowing open the petals of ten thousand peartrees.
...With the war-fires that have broken ten thousand miles
And the cold sky, seeing the heights,
Dry the water in our temples, cutting at our hoofs.
And I, a prisoner, a guest of the north,
On Zhidun Mountain, a mile from here,
Watch the rising snow-plum and the white frost
And, with the enemy dead on the northern border,
There are people on both sides of the mountain!



A SONG OF Chinese RIVER IN FAREWELL
TO FIELD-CLERK WU GOING HOME

Going back now from home, I half expect this river
And the first flight of Chinese lads woods-horned.
...The flag of Great Britain is gone, and no one touches it.
What are the flags of other hemispheres? --
The wildgeese of China frown on us now,
While Wei Shi, our hosts, remain and weep.
Our host, a guest of the north,
Ships from Jia Gezhen, sends word
That southward we have to travel, eastward,
Like people returning from a long journey,
Not arriving by post, but disappearing later.
...Our host, a guest of the south,
Delivers me this tip-knife-smokeless night,
Contrary to earlier voyages.
On the third day, in the Yellow River trough,
We meet there Ockmen, both Yuan and Zhou.
Both of them are bringing with them news
Of adventure and of hostship,
Of the Huaiyan and the Zhouyan dynasties.
...The Jin Kingdom, under the protection of the two great states
Which had become the domain of the few,
Is preparing the capital of all the world,
And Shanghai is the centre of trade and of intercourse.
To secure this capital, the government of the Emperor has to go beyond politics
And into the market-place.
Minister Li Peng brings in this news from Jiangtown.
The Emperor has only one disciple left,
And that is his mistresses:
Old Chunye is the wife of the Premier of Shenyang.
Highly he sends him messages of welcome;
But what can he wish a ten million man,
Brighten with pure air his lamp-flies?
...In an age of talk and touch of war,
China's great premier has to confront his greatest rival,
With his own two swords he can sink an empire.
...But the war-torch is massive and can hold ten thousand ships;
So he goes about his business, inclusively free-spirited,
As soon as he sees the sun as he moves near.
By my rigorously tested hunting-horse, Bash, I have mastered the art of hunting.
And now, in the third year of the Yang Kingdom,
When the barbarian sun is upcote, redoubling my strength,
I lose sight of my home and of Bash in the long pass.


A SONG OF SOBBING BY THE JADE POOL

I was thinking of going back home,
Suddenly an old song fills
My soul with affairs of spring and summer.

Those who were lost in the thick misty mountain.
And someone of ordinary mind
Could see beyond a world deprived of friends.

She studies alone in her chamber,
No husband to see her for three months;

She thinks of beauty in pairs and sings her poem;
And when she grows thin and pale and tired,
She asks his advice on how to improve her beauty
Through the use of charms and the use of music.


ON HEARING A GIRL FROM LIANGCHUAN

I am the daughter of a prosperous merchant in northeastern Jiangye Fortress
And I remember you, from childhood, from your chrysanthemum trees,
Serving in the Chinese army,
Playing flutes and singing tenorclines.
With a sound of wind and rain, grasses that have spoiled the spring,
Trees have begun to blossom in the evening,
And wheat and barley will follow in the dust
And wheat and barley-cups will begin to float
In an endless limpid river of sweet cinnamon.


AT A BANQUET IN THE HOUSE
OF THE TAOIST PRIEST MEI

Now that a gust blew my candle-pan,
Could I not write a poem?
...Oh, at last this stranger is coming


BEYOND SEEING
The Jade Pass is high on a ladder,
Where white clouds are gathering the cloud;
But a rose would beacing the Tartar;
But his dream had to end there
Because of his low birthage.


BEYOND SEEING
The Forbidden City is aflame with candle-flowers,
And candles are flying upside-down into the
Sunset of night.
If he dreamed it were held by a human being,
Would it matter?


HARD IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD III

The way is broad like the blue sky,
But no way out before his eye.
He builds a ladder over a swamp and a sea of sand;
And, at the foot of the A320 scale, is laden with rain
And puddles with it before he drowns in it.


HEARD OR SMASHED A POEM

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And unicorns perch ten meters high
And a wildgoose from the Mountain of Heaven caws ten meters high....
I am sitting by a tall maple-trees,
The front is slashed by wildhorns,
The shade is burning ten thousand pine-trees.
The street is mired in dark faces.
There are few who love China enough to pay by their bell.


TO CLIMB AT BAICHELL

To the ancient temple of Sanchang.
The ground where we are being trained
Is stained with blood by the thousand stains of the Taiyuan River.
The father of these warriors is illiterate;
And his sons are descended from them like blood.
We watch the moon go down an ancient dragon-river,
And the wind of Fuliang jutting out at five-threes.
...The teacher of this poet, beloved of Yangzhou,
Is bringing to a sad-hearted visitor your book
Which states, in camel's hair, that the Taiyuan Trail begins at the foot of theMountain.
Oh, at last you and I can share the cup!
We Yueh, bringing with us written copies of your works,
And we both know that true learning is rectification.
We are both exalted to levels of genius!
Why not write more?


TO A FRIEND BOUND EAST

To Basinglis as south as the Yangzi has flown
And clouds and winds have flown past my solitary hut.
At news of a stranger my heart and my soul
Are whirling through the eastern sky.
...From the wide-angle, the (Pg XI)adan sky,
The autumn flood whose peak the city's defences
Are hanging, beyond all hope, from the single tear.
The nearness of the wind, the nearness of clouds;
The nearness of earth, the nearness of sea.
...I came, a year ago, to Basinglis to see you,
And you, a year ago, to Baling in the misty....
I come, a year, to see you, then south along the river.

...The cloud-line is bloody and the sky is dark with dew....
The Parrot House is nothing if not ruthless;
You have to repay me, at a little tribute,
To sow my field through triple years of rain.


IN HARMONIZING CAMP

The King of Yan was fond of autumn and was setting out for China,
So that I take my wife to the Capital of beauties
And
======================================== SAMPLE 79 ========================================
For ten thousand years, all that has happened there has been done,
And the Tartar chieftain's hunting-horse, with his green hair,
His longboat, drifting westward,
Its waves brushing the sand, washing away the birds.
...When the Chinese Emperor heard of your cause, he summoned your favours,
He summoned your affairs late into the palace.
...You retired, then, from fishing-boats and to your boat the white ford,
And from hunting-flowers all night long to the south.
Now when the wildgeese and the lynxes are falling afoul of the Tartar,
Why should the Emperor's heart hate you for it?



THE HARD ROAD

Ram was the first to admit of his money,
Bengal gatlings are the second to hail from the West,
And the third dish out from the imperial palace
Is a challenge from the South Ruler samented.
But now, when your fame is spreading so quickly,
And when pearls of the Danube can be sold in open market,
And when Emperor Wen armour stands between heaven and earth,
And when Emperor Wei's dagger is barely a shell --
Now, at least, I have my bow and arrow at my belt.


THE HARD ROAD

Toward a bleak landscape darkens with misty clouds
Toward buds of the Eastern and Southern Woods
Colours of autumn wearisomely done
And work is done for the North Star from the temple.
Night has reached the capital, and farmers no homesick tomorrow.
And the farmers that are scattered by dust
Are as far away from their homes as Niagara and the River of Heaven.
So askai Canaries along the Jade Pass
On cicadas wheeling and dealing
And tai chi practitioners teaching hand to hand.
Across the spring-day water a chill creeps in the pines
And a chill is heard to be breaking the dew on the jade-white armour...
But where is the soft sound of a wind at dusk?



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

relating alone to the past,
Yet tending a life of herymos added to her scattered songs.
The martial artist says:
"I came, wandering in a land of herymos,
No one but my teacher, teacher that has never heard of me,
I listen to only the spring songs.
...Like so many in a crowd, singing, I am passing the maids' orders
As I brood on her newlyweds mare, mare, foal, calf, whelm;
Her hair was painted in the finest country homesafe crayon
And her jade hairpins fast becoming her only mirror --
That is why she brings them, twice a day, to the rowhouse.
...It is not so very far to her City of the Pearl
Eunuchs are fleeing famine in the river.
Be wary of those in the White Robe, for my dagger is gone.
...The guards will not listen to our complaint
And swift as lightning cannot sail a mountain.
JADE WEAPON

The Yellow Jade Wing has been promised a thousand battles,
And a bright spear-case to hold her banners.
When shall she campaign the following day with jade?
Apple-trees mean firm winter on the mountain,
Hard with the pouring snow on Windursten.
And a good many names remembered --
This lion-mound was once her court-come,
And her jade-blue temple is a cloud of ruin...
But name be damned, court and temple are all built on the mountain,
And toll pilgrims twice the size of towns.
...When the star-ziaired gong was shaking the sand,
And the strings, horns and a cry of pines
And the sand gulles whined,
The Jade City was left standing,
As the bandaged hand of a warrior left the fighting.
...At Qutang, south of the City of the Rising Sun,
Ten thousand warriors came to be known.
They were soldiers known as marksmen,
Brocades known as birds flew high.
They offered gold to the selling-crow, sang in the wind
And lavished all their might on the building-man.
...When the fur coat of the flying foxe faltered,
Brocades were swift as rivers and reached the earth.
They circled the Realm of the Red Dragon, checking the Power of the Wind.
They shot the midnight dart across the Void.
And cleanly steering a thousand sails a man
Has made the Silk City gold and the Day-Gates silver.
...While a snow-peak opens on a cloud-line

======================================== SAMPLE 80 ========================================
And as the moon rises beyond the bright horizon,
Drifting in space, flying in water,
We hear the saying, "Is fame only a calling?"


A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

As I linger on the banks of a river,
Wildgeese fly up to me from the far sky.
...There are only a few policemen on the river,
And the cold water bitterlyands butterflies.
I wear his pegged skirt and his fishnet sleeveless coat
And passes his midnight doorframe, watching the moonlight.


STAYING AT THE HEADQUARTERS

The stars and the River of Heaven are low and empty
And I on a wide path of white cloud
I wait for the coming of a mythical spirit.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

Forlorn in the west between mountains and rivers,
In the moonlight of a southern city-gate,
I watch a phantom man on his way to court.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES II

The city-gate opens into a maze of towers.
I waited for the coming of a lordly being.
I am shadowed in the street like a moon that fell.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME III

Ten thousand heads envy a city-gate flame,
And a hundred thousand see the same brownness
Wherein lie the last vestige of a glory that was old:
The temple-girls wept as we tested our swords.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES IV

This broken wall between heaven and earth grips the two halves of the river;
And yet no one comes upon earth firm enough to break it?
...Storms of spring on the banks of Lake Dongting,
And how wide the Danes are on the Danube River,
How wide the Portugese are on the Island of Maori!


THOUGHTS OF MOUNTAIN-CLIMB
IMPORTANT THOUGHTS

This Mongolia-Clove-Tibet border post overlooks the plain
Is bound for the western valley of the sea,
Where people are emptying locales of rain.
The wildgeese, alert to a new danger,
Cast a campaign of horse and chariot, sinking both ways and at will.
...While the capital-state is abuzz, they complain,
That their government is crushed under the pounds,
And hundreds of thousands drown in the sea.


ON THE BORDER-FORks of autumn in the three Jin districts
The massive defences at Qutang collapse,
Till the only hope of escape is the life-force of the strongman.
...Tankers for the enemy fall to the ground,
And horses for the Chinese in terror.
Meanwhile people in the two southern rivers are washing their cars.
...A hundred miles from the capital, people are returning the favor --
Last night a fisherman from Shuanghi catch a fish.


ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
THINKING OF MY BROTHERS IN SHU

All alone in a foreign land,
I am little more than an old stranger,
With noONES in the two monied houses.
...The poor and the old are leaving me,
As we cry and wail in the river wind.
I am passing, between towns, the few residents
Who still remember the days when our favours were divided;
And I am smiling now on the white-brimmed hat I wear
As I walk the quiet path that leads to our house.


ON MY WAY TO HUAZHOU
AFTER A NIGHT THOUGHT

The Emperor had gone crazy last night in the lake,
And the lady in the yellow silk chamberaunted the moon with her song.
...The Imperialist triumph was achieved, broke tenions,
And song and dance were brought the world.
The Dragon Mound, the Seven-Moon Hills, have just come under my chain,
With the help of a sudden the wildgeese and chickens
Dip into the Omei River bed.


MY SONG OF THE NIGHT

The barbarian river Gorges is at bay,
And Schellabs is greying- rough.
The Lady of the Pool makes her welcome,
And the Tartar chieftain home at last.
The Emperor has sent for me.
Gorges are death, moments I have little memory of.
I am old and drunk and cannot breath again.
...Late was the festival when my kinsmen -
Who had come from far away --
And who had spent the better part of their lives
As meteors from the south have flown.
And so I youni, you die
======================================== SAMPLE 81 ========================================
In its twilight deep in the valley,
The ferry brings us insectsong-worthy
And a magical music fills the river and the mountains.
...Where the hands of a few are great
And the fame of a long-neckleeed horse
Happily imaginable, even in this world.
In reaching my dream, I put aside my wine.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
Watching it alone from the window of her chamber-
For our boy and girl, poor little babes,
Are too young to know where the Capital is.
Her cloudy hair is sweet with mist,
Her jade-white shoulder is cold in the moon.
...When shall we lie again, with no more tears,
Watching this bright light on our screen?


A SPRING VIEW

Though a country be sundered, hills and rivers endure;
And spring comes green again to trees and grasses
Where petals have been shed like tears
And lonely birds have sung their grief.
...After the war-fires of three months,
One message from home is worth a ton of gold.
...I stroke my white hair. It has grown too thin
To hold the hairpins any more.


A NIGHT-VIGIL IN THE LEFT COURT OF THE PALACE

Flowers are shadowed, the palace darkens,
Birds twitter by for a place to perch;
Heaven's ten thousand windows are twinkling,
And nine cloud-terraces are gleaming in the moonlight.
...While I wait for the golden lock to turn,
I hear jade pendants tinkling in the wind....
I have a petition to present in the morning,
All night I ask what time it is.


TAKING LEAVE OF FRIENDS ON MY WAY TO HUAZHOU


This is the road by which I fled,
When the rebels had reached the west end of the city;
And terror, ever since, has clutched at my vitals
Lest some of my soul should never return.
...The court has come back now-green and clear-shaking-with pearls,
With the breaks on either side of the tombcircling still;
But the day is changed to dawn for the Qinets,
With the southern border cordoned-off, and the southwest frontier closed to the Han.
...The captured ships complain of darkness --
They also say that a siege-horn was hurled;
And the Premier holds forth his whip for no other reason than that
He has been longing for this city since the winter-time.

ON RETURNING AT THE PALACE OF HEARTS-RECAPTURED

Tar-China Sea
With no sign of a Chinese ship, ever since the spring storms;
Here war-plagued with famine, wars, and ravages;
And along the wall of the Palace of Long Life
Mornings are dyed with the changing colours of the day;
And at sunset, when the danger of frost grows too great,
All around us are fears and anxieties;
Yet we remain still-tuft-hearted to the staple dishes of the house.
...Returning, he found that the Kingdom was pitiable
Because of its external condition;
That player on the international key could not enter;
That patron of iron and sea-worms could not save;
There were, at Pompei, thousands of witches seeking
The perils of the Yellow River.


RETURNING AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Away from home, I must go for a walk.
Under the rocks, I hear birds in the chiruleys rustling.
Around the corner, the old defences crumble,
The Golden Temple is shaken with evil will....
Yet here in the City of the Red Phoenix, autumn rains are pouring
With pink clouds scaling the sky and sea-myrecks bearing down
All the while calling from its nine corners.


A SPRING SONG

With my back to the gaoler, I sing a quiet song
Against the cold sound in the court of the Red Phoenix.
For three nights in the thirties I have been hearing
Alleyspouts, harpists,pmwiki:Filter:
I have heard voices in the night at the green wall o'er the autumn sea;
But I have come home, with a sad ear,
To my husband's cottage in the street-hanging from the wind.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

There's a solitary lantern, weeping in the spring rain;
Across the spring-peak a solitary rooster wanes;
Hearts o'clock in the morning a cold wind blows

======================================== SAMPLE 82 ========================================
THE OLD SONG OF A BUDDHIST MONK

A monk from Loyang comes to Youzhou asking if he can use the song of a mountain
Till his soul should reach the City of the Red God.
The music is grave and aching,
Bamboos smell of amethyst.
...By the way, a moment's thought goes
As we talk, hefts a light cross into a cup,
Washing his hands to make them wet.
The monk motions us to bring them to you,
Hearts murmur their contents among the mountainside.
...We reply that they are sweet, though they have medicinal
Flowers, we have no means of making my wine bitter.
We continue our conversation, then turn and see the morning
Snow stripping at the outer bank.
We have watched the white line of mountainside go in the evening,
And snowdrops fall like a mirror on a dew
On the Mountain of Heaven.


AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

After rain the empty mountain
Stands autumnal in the evening,
Moonlight in its groves of reeds,
Bamboos worthily green, birds in their rosy airs.
...The region is shaken by the thought that
That someone as ancient as the Sun can live like them.
And yet nobody cares for this valley like the Chinese.
Time will heal the wounds of those it has hurt --
And morning will bring a shower of tears.


BORDER-SONGS III

His procession is moving, gathering,
But what does it mean to be a warrior in the river?
Tibet is a desolate land,
And our envoy, a grey-haired duke,
Can't keep his distance from his flock.
So he and his family are taken captive
To a place of bandung on the Xunyang River.
...The familiar song of the apes continues,
Whose hands now are on the harp and the melody has been copied
And the host sings, with wistful eyes, of a happy king
With jade and wine, at the Five Oceans,
And under the Yellow Star, with Eastern Flowers
And of thunderbirds and of whirlwinds,
That no one can but be a guest of the mountains.


A MESSAGE TO CENSOR HAN CHO

There is a cool in the near-by trees,
A quiet in the evening in the far palace garden.
You and your young howled, in the closed temple,
Three generations undone by fortune.
...Here in the City of the Red Phoenix the Long March
Is calling himself a wanderer. He is nearing the border.


Cicadas complain of thin grasses
In the winding mountains of the south
When people turn south from China.
They cross sandy bank where old cypresses hang
And green water runs down below them like a duck and a water- tiger.
...The old priest at Liangzhou, killing birds for meat,
Howled his fellow pilgrims to go home.


Cicadas complain of cold rivers and damp mountains
In the bleak mountain dawn,
As darkness besets the dawn of dawn;
A cuckoo cries through the gloom
And the dew from trees in the early sunshine
Is creeping across the city of Yangzhou.


Is it not tragic how wronged
Can birds of the palm-branch be
Justices in heaven, who can refer the affairs of state
And never address fierceness to the people.


Be wary of the flying carp, domestic animals
Have one drink for the day, for their odours


A SONG OF PURE Emissaries

By my direct command to announce to the whole earth
How many yearned for Theo since they broke the cord,
They came by a sudden breeze to where we were.
Auspicious of your sudden fame, we asked your parents,
They told us nothing.
Then telling us their children had been sent away,
They told us that whose are you bringing
And whose are you bringing today?


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME
ON THE CHU RIVER

A cold light lies in the city-gate.
I think of you in a lake of sweat;
So I ask myself three simple questions.
--Tomorrow you are to leave the lake,
And I leave the throne unfinished.


ON THE BORDER

Though a bugle breaks the crystal air of autumn,
Soldiers, in the look-out, watch at ease today
The spring wind blowing across green graves
And empty courtyards yesterday....
Yesterday was a sad event,
With the war-ruled north stopping offer and the south stopping its tracks.
...Our General
======================================== SAMPLE 83 ========================================
The City of Silk is shaken with the rushing of boat and horse.
Her boat turns back without waiting river or harbour,
And Dragon Lake spirit with wave from the sea....
How wide the world is, how far the blue mountains have to go!
And, for her part, Queen Zhou has lived on Kirby Mountain
For almost thirty years.



THE EARLY MORNING SHOW

Zhou is at the gate, but a wildgeese still apes talk.
The host invites him back from the sell-outs
To a tent made of mats and silk
And to dinner brought with him from the booth
And with a wordless warning scrawled on the side of the plate:
"Leaving Kaoru, move south! ...The moon is rising again, and we cannot help crying....
Birds flock and sing when the road is clear and the wind gentle;
Flower-shadows climb and wane as rivers and mountains proceed;
Dragons are slow to anger and to anger's horses;
Dogs are tame and harmless and never harmful,
And the mind of man can be purified of sensuality and of worldly woes:
Yet these things are on offer in the shop, by the pillory,
On meat and drink and dance and in the large plate of wine.
And so I, aldening in my garden,
Gave a banquet to my good Emperor,
When he grew gaunt from feasting and the wine was too much.
We had plenty and we had fun and vented our talents --
But the point is, we all die young and poor.
...Our banners and our game perish, our heroes are washed away....
We may wear moustaches and we may livery horses,
But we all die young and poor, poor we ourselves.



We have brought our bows and our menhirets with us,
And we shake our cups and we sigh,
As we do little beyond shaking our heads.
At Qutb Province we settled --
And staying for two years in the western valley --
That drunkenenmost mountains our boys went to war on;
And here at the Yangzhou Town high rock and small bird
Comes the real idiom of the matter --
That our dead boys and girls bet against each other
And the girls in dance seek their elders' approval
And, spreading the news of foreign soil,
All four quarters are known and knowned --
And among the nearby trees the name of Yi is known
And among the nearby bushes the name of Lu Xin --
And among the hills and the landscape the name of Wu is known
And among the nearby grasses the name of Lu is known
And among the nearby grasses the name of Wu is known
 -- all of them are known by the first name of Wu.

...From the ruined city-gate all night long the wind of Rhoads
Suffers a climate of weather that might make a forest burn.
...In the flood-torch along the Silken River no one has come home.
And now comes the day of the Chinese Dynasties,
When the strong will be exalted to the throne and the weaker to be the rulers;
And this reign comes to an end and men of high rank perish.
...I tug at my hairpins of white barley, hoping for news;
I gaze at the moon above guttering and fiddling,
Nothing surprising but rain and sleet.



THE HARD ROAD

Nothing should bring me such a challenge as a challenge from the mighty;
For, with their high rank beyond compare,
The Danes are like rulers of heaven and earth content
And the Lingaeans like lords of Queens content
With the low fortunes of this world and this one planet.
...My master, educated and able-bodied,
Is descended from a class of ordinary men
With dowry no better than the rarest of all silver,
His heritage tested, his will tested;
But as sovereign he has failed to hold his friends in his army
And has concentrated his efforts only on capturing the city of Hebei.
In the hope that his efforts will last forever,
The Emperor sends him ensign, to be his most favoured pupil.
He is highly talented, but not as brilliant as he ought to be,
And people, feeling his bitter disappointment,
Exceed all their want with songs of heaped pheasants.
...Flower- giants grow weary of the long road home,
And their white dew is rising beyond understanding
And anxious men move beyond the chair they have been assigned
To move, along the bank of the Yellow River, several hundred miles.
And clear as snow on the banks of the Yellow River,
Trees and shrubs are fragrant and happy,
Waves of rain on the
======================================== SAMPLE 84 ========================================
I am pouring a cup of wine inside a Golden Cock.
Selling at a silver buck
Fine is life to a man without a wife,
And existence beyond existence.
Therefore I bid you a drink and asked you to draw a breath,
As you float between worlds of magical and mundane,
Into hell, out on the town-lease,
Empty of people nor of cargo.


TAKING LEAVE OF WANG WEI

I face, high gaming-hole, the western capital of rain,
I face, low gaming-hole, the northern city of snow.
...city-keepers and officials are coming and going,
Not knowing when to stop.
For example, back in the day, when of today's stalls
Exams are called in, there are even examiner's cluttering the hall.
...Henceforth I was often absent-minded
And late at night checking for games,
Whether any one be playing by the open fire.


DRINKING WITH WANG WEI

Lakka-leaves are cooked in a wine-pan,
With chewy rice the shell is cooked,
And, if desired, thick with flavour,
And, as in the olden days, full of flavour,
And, tipsy with gourds of the lakka-leaves,
We celebrate here, not just the life
But the culture of the whole country,
How to drink, where to eat!


LOOKING DOWN A RIVER

Lakka-leaves are held along the waterfront,
Not far from the two imperial palaces.
And the evening Gompers are waiting,
Not far from the two fortified cities.
...East of the Wall Street Fairy Courts, midnight Gompers
Bring in royal reeds
And pomegranates in a teeming crowd.


A SPRING SONG

The stars of last night are blowing over
Forty-eight thousand bridges;
There are houses sundered in the snow;
And the autumn mountains are glimmering on the southwest
And the river near the city.
...I hear a woman in a tower sob on her harp
While she and her five children run for cover in the sand.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

"My name is Citizen and I am the Li Palace guest
Through the chrysanthemum in color of green cedar.
Here, when my lady has desired a place,
Come and see me at the palace-gate,
Forgesurf champing hot wings!


CHANGING ON OLD FRIENDS IN THE BUDDHIST COURT

While the old faithful endure the rainy night,
Newsters are thrown in the morning air,
And the monk from Wu Palace comes home with a cry.
Spring, as in the wild wild-fire,
Is ceasing at Chu Gong Mountain.


A LITERARY SONG AT THE BUDDHIST COURT

Dare I, at my old age, accept my summons,
Knowing nothing of the world,
To wander the unending river of snow?....
The boughs are one with the lilting,
And the daily fare is belt-drive --
I will bear it no more.


A SONG OF A GIRL FROM LOYANG

So autumn has ended near the border,
And the autumn flowers are no help to a farewell feast;
Forgiveness is a shell in a tank top,
And my white hair is dusted with tears.
Sad is my day, and still deeper my sorrow.


A GREETING ON THE HUAI RIVER
TO MY OLD FRIENDS FROM LIANGCHUAN

We used to be companions on the Jiang and the Yue,
And as often as we met, we were likely to be tipsy.
Since we left one another, floating apart like clouds,
Ten years have run like water-till at last we join again.
And we talk again and laugh again just as in earlier days,
Except that the thread on our faces is tinged now with grey.
Why not come along, then, all of us together,
And face the autumn mountains and sail along the Huai?



A FAREWELL IN THE EVENING RAIN TO MY FRIEND CHEN ZHU

Is it raining on the river all the way to Chu? -- -
The evening rain is creeping slowly through the grasses,
The early stars are twinkling in the deserted moon,
Though a dread of an earthquake weighs on my heart.
...After the war-fires of three months, four nights a day,
With no one to talk to or to care for us,
With no one to relate
======================================== SAMPLE 85 ========================================
Blue Mountains, high and deep,
Where willows guide the mists of the night?
...Marsh-lands, deep and wide,
Are walls of snow
Where willows bar the cold sky?


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen five-thirty
And Kalashnikov-rifles chortle like phoenix-finches.
...Though a man befriends a lost friend,
Still he has to leave a place he has visited.
Villagers, away from home,
See how hard it is to find a good wife.
...Oh, let him in his little garden
Where spring wanes and weeds are vainly seeking
And summer grows cold with a moan in its lonely grass.


ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where deep in the net of night
The wind from a campfire, Australian and other marks
And insects dote on grasses and grow pale,
I climb to the top. I confront the great Emperor
And, content with my youth and abundant tears,
I summon the distant city-gate.
...The sky is wide open to us,
Under the hanging rocks and the slow stream.
Let us Waterstones ring the lonely mountain
And Grunge the longitude
With a sad song.


A FAREWELL TO WEI WAN

The barbarian world is in middle age
And the Westinghouse reaps the jade.
To him from lowly to high, from lowly to high
There is no getting back.
He is barely old enough to go back home.
He restlessly rouses himself by chopping wood
And colors himself aloft by a sunset.
He caricatures the spring wind in his sails.
He caricatures the flying rain in his betrothed.
- Han
You are of ordinary moral character.
You are a poor poor man with a gambling-bell.
You derive your pay by cheating on your maid.
You deceive the living one by letting him lie low.
You cry on the jade bank of the Yangzi
Because no one cares for your good looks.
You tread grain-silk along the bank of the river
And grow thick with the wildgeese' song --
NOT FORTRESSING"

Mist clings to the Medicine-Ship's fog-uct at the far western river.
...Who lives to see the western horizon again?
For ever vigilant in my enforcement of the law,
May I yield the city-gate, for this coyote!


A SONG OF THE SOUTHERN RIVER

Patience may be a sign of land,
But nature chooses endurance for a lot of wine.
...At a thirty-eight risk, I barreled westward
Through a place of wear and tear termed the "Rivers of Heaven."
When the ferry-boat brings me hay, I plough it barefoot;
And when the country is brisk and the seasons are brisk,
I chuse to drive the fisher-boat home.
...Soon the southern tip of the mountains is teeming
With the hearty drink of the Black Mountain.
If I am not careful, what am I good for?
...I am the kind of man who lives by the yellow-shadows-antonim
And drinks to his great music.
Whichever way he marches, his horses neigh.
And what is to be ashamed of?
His ears are pure with dart and he loves the music.
Eunuchs are changing into white clouds
And setting out from the Capital.
And a villager from Wu --
Who is fond of music and is showing his hand
 --
May he never leave home.



SPRING RAIN

While rain delays his advance,
Drink up the cloud, for the long march!
The south is rolling again;
And now in the last lake of mango-willows
There is no Hope Poor Mother!



AT A BANQUET IN THE HOUSE
OF THE TAOIST PRIEST MEI

I open the door of my northern palace.
The breeze is constantly in my way.
I am like a petal-cedar clad in rain-clouds
Till every fibre of my being is beset with affairs.
...I have prayed that I might ask the Holy Ghost,
To reveal to my true self the heart of a roused youth.
I have been drawn to the Northern Palace so that my sisters
And grandchildren might study from home
And be fortunate enough to attend theorial feasts.
...But the cup I so gratefully bear is a cup given her by a peer
Who is most dear to us, and least likely to approach us,

It has taken years to restore the heritage of these two great temples
Yet girls from Confu Gong leave home
To spend the night in the western sky;
Preside as pale as a snow-cone.



BORDER-SONGS XI

Preparing me a cold stare, a wolf tries
To be a brother to a wolf is harder than climbing the mountain.
Therefore I lie awake and thinking of you,
As thoughts that drift like mist within a bough.
Watch the waves of the waves of the sea, the pear-shaped wave
Whichever way I look on the moon.


BORDER-SONGS II

Passing in the dusk from the Eastern Palace,
I find the naked street-dress of Lady de Long standing
On her bed, facing the lamp, her dagger in her left hand.
Her dark hair has been scalded, her wound is bandaged,
And bitter tears have been shed by her eyes that she may not cry,
As she tries to read the label on the label on her water-bottle.


BORDER-SONGS III

Till now I bare my head and weep,
For my darling, in the eastern range,
The Long Road.


BORDER-SONGS IV

Oh, while the Westback's glimmer of slaughter
On the yellow-silk-silk of Zelteim,
Let's bury our head-trees here and there!
Let us brook no more barbarians --
Let us flock closer and closer!


BORDER-SONGS V

Keep watch at the western gate, watch for flying horses.
The barbarians never leave the western gate.
They wander free at the next town crossing;
Till among the fallen leaves of a mountain,
Let there be a new scent of mountain-plant
And autumn dew my jade hair.


BORDER-SONGS -- A TRAVELLENT DAY

Long spent on the mountain,
Send westward on a tortuous boat
Wolves no longer even to White Wolf Hill usrish;
And dark clouds are crossing the Mountain-Horse River.


A CONFESSION

With my wine-bottle, watching the day,
I am listening to a guest.
He is from long ago, full of sessions;
He asks me where I have been on my journey.
I told him my name is Otto and he answered:
"Recently went to China."


IN THE TEMPLE OF THE FIRST KING OF SHU

My body was still a guest at Qing Palace,
And soon after came to the visit of all the nobles
Among the trees of Huai.
Your soul has been lost, in the mystery
Of the dynasty of Prince Guoguo.



Through the haze of war, through the chill of night
You have buried your head in the sand
And gone on insuling your countrymen for many years.
You have torn down the Great God's name
And given it your domain in exchange for it's person
And assigned it both divine and human features.
...It is certain that in exchange for this man's life
You will give in to the wings of many an appetite.


A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the Temple of the Great Premier stands an ancient cypress
With a trunk of green bronze and a root of stone.
The girth of its white bark would be the height of a mountain
And its tip of kingfish-blue is two thousand feet in heaven.
If this Eastern River country be spared the winds of year,
Freedom of the press after the Eastern Dragon Pass,
Boling the Jewines southward into China,
I would cross it at dawn; but stopping at the Jade Pass and breaking the girths of trees
Would be fatal.


A SONG OF THE GONGS OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the Temple of the Bright Sun of Ye among birds in the night sky
Are solitary palms and manganese- dragons,
Living off the dust in the river,
Mountain-notes blowing down, mastiffs bucking,
Till the red odours of the woods cause me great anguish.
...I have a cypress along the banks of the river
And a pear outrunning the cliffs.
If this new-setgrass be left alone,
On its banks of green grasses there shall be no weeds
And the coursingberry-river vainly calls home...


A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the Flowery Robe- Tower-Bride stands preparing to leave,
Hailcatting from the wings its adventure.
...No, no more nights of the month! Pesticks

Here in the city a priest urges you to join the poor and the desolate
In breathing new life into old garments,
You who have lost your way in the old and shadowy world,
Now comes the priest to your vacant pines,
Where you must leave the quiet and wander barefoot
In a world of void and voidly.
...Shall peace be bound my old cave,
And new storms roam my little island?
O feeble-hearted people, whose dwellings I so tremble
Who are you to decide today?



WE BOUND THE MOON

Flowers and a wind, over a mound of soil
Where a fisherman was watching. Looking through hundreds
Of a cloudy sky, through a mooring of rain....
I watch a fisherman casting a net
Where is the broad river running northward?
Or do you, my poor friend, desire bliss in this cloud?


A CLIMB ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
TO THE TERRACE WHENCE ONE SEES THE MAGICIAN
A POEM SENT TO VICE-PREFECT LU

The Han Emperor Wen bequeathed us this terrace
Which I climb to watch the coming dawn.
Cloudy peaks run northward in the two southern rivers,
And the river running southward is headed west.
...Who knows but me about the Guard at the Gate,
Or where the Magician of the River Bank is,
Or how to find that magistrate, that poet,
Who was as fond as I am of chrysanthemums and winecups?


ON LEAVING THE TOMBS

Where are the Leves de Condours?
By a bearwest of spring snow
On the snowy mountain toward the south;
And the autumn moon glistens on a ruined river temple,
Time has not yet vanquished the beauty of these walls.


ON THE GATE-TOWER AT YOUZHOU

I have been waiting in the dark
For you to leave Thebes.
I wait for you there only a moment longer.
Because of the earthquake in Ninevone,
And the rain that fell on fields where you are coming
And the slanting sun, you must go where you please:
A northern lady, fluting you through rain,
You who have come from Thebes, to Wu temple,
Where the mind of Man in the Southern Trees
Exiles to a life of luxury.


A MESSAGE

I am the Great General at the Wheel Tower, resting
On a cross that I wear to give my all to each other.
People, compassionate, carefree,
When you are with me since the first day of Spring,
Weeps, our chests are full with soup.
Why do they weep all night long?


ON HEARING A FLUTE AT NIGHT
FROM THE WALL OF SHOUXIANG

To the spring of the River Phoenix
I am running, I am hearing, from my deck.
A lone bell-boy shivers in the dusk.
...The war-wind's heat
Dryens the hair on my crown.


I TOLD YOU HEARNINGLY IMPERIAL

Rapids hum over swollen plains
And wildgeese fly half the way to Youzhou.
...If this earth could last forever,
Could human hearts be like those of a cow-boy?



A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Cicadas are southward, flying past city-villages.
...With the night moving eastward,
And the mountain moving westward,
All the mountain-peaks are gone....
I crossed the Dagestan mountain-wall
And flew down to the capital,
Where sunlight came dimly to my rosyade.
I saw a cicada flying eastward,
And a wildgoose crossing the Wall of Stone.
...When are they going again, I wonder?


A NOTE LEFT FOR AN ABSENT ECLUSE

After my error as a Carnifeur,
The year was long spent in prayer.
The Ecluse River was running slowly,
And the House of the River Moon was high and shining.
I entreated the Power of Heaven to grant my pleading,
In exchange for my servant moving in with me.
The affliction which affronted me cumbered
All of a kind that was witnessed by no one but the Emperor.
I withdrew my robe and besought the Helven Sea-monster
To come and meet me, face to face, at the Gate of Gold.
But he failed his urgent summons, and instead of me summoned by my master
Entering the capital, I was fined and led to an outdoor grave
And, alas, as a mark of my high position,
To

Oh, how can we bear to lose one another?



TO LI QIAN PALACE

Her tears are falling over her heart,
She cannot hold a grudge,
No more needs her hairpins of white jade.
Even the temple priest who cleanses the soul
And forgets the cause of death
Has forgotten the guilt of my action.
No grieve-girls to follow, no memorial candles
To her lonely grief-place, forever hidden.


IN THE COLD

Who said that the western slope is cuckoos' faith?
...The trees in the distance are as close to heaven
Blue clouds as they are long ago,
And the moon like a white stream in the midnight sun.
You monkeys, monkeys, if monkeys are my faith, why haven't I prayed?



THINKING OF A FRIEND LOST
IN THE TIBETAN WAR

Last year you went with your troops to Tibet.
When the wars over the Yangtze and the Trail of Tears
Came to a great defeat in the Battle of the Bulge,
You saw your friend's body strewn by the enemy's lines.
...While soldiers wait for him to return,
A tractor-trailer rolls by, lonely and withered.


A NIGHT AT A TAVERN

Solitary at the tavern,
I am shut in with loneliness and grief.
I am thought to be lost in my own song.
...The moon has opened wide in a desert of tears,
And the wind has whipped the sand in a duel.
...The strong walk two thousand miles together,
Single- handedly fighting in the desert.
...The weak climb two thousand stairs together,
With no other source of support than the weight of the world.
...Beside all that is new is old and witless,
It is like facing the sun in a misty gate.


AT A TEMPLE ON A MOONLIGHT

Thoughtful of rain, how do I moonlight
When a spirit goes awry in a spell at the temple?
...The rain has left the sky, and green fig- vines flourish
On the second Friday of every month;
And idly the Adventists blessfully wait
For that moment when their three young children
Will have a father to their lord.


A SPRING SONG

In gala robes the alcove of spring is opened,
And the moon and the wind are in flowered silks
And the performers strut their wares in the street
As Fendi, The Fool, and Little Red Robin sing.
The setting sun is brooding in his Yangzhou pavilion,
And strings of Montreal grate on the oriens' cloister.
...My troupe of dancers have departed, I hear.
Red leaves are wet with autumn rain;
Blue in the palace are wearing moth blood
And a chill is blowing across the river
As I watch my dewy green silk curtains.


IN SPRING ON THE GATE

The moon is in silken ripples,
The stars are in space,
And the sky is at peace as before!
Your caravan, which I have sent away,
Has not yet driven far.
Your camel, which I have left behind,
Will surely need bringing it back.
Shall BUSINESS men of China
Prep for work in three months?
And are you still struggling to attend to your horses?
Or are you preparing like the great Lords of the Realm?


A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

On a mountain with no one to proceed,
The River of Yellow Jade runs your direction.
...I surrender, I beg you to surrender,
All I have are your bones and your arttership.
If they thank you, they will repay me in full
Ten thousand words.


THE TEMPLE OF THE PREMIER OF THE BUDDHIST PRIEST YE

In the green light of a flash of angels,
The five Holy Mountains of the south
Shatter into one the world:
Theist, follower, and guest
Are incarnated in the Power of the Three Gong stages.
...Theist, follower, and guest
Hail the Light of the Three Imperial Palaces, Prince of Friends.
Renouncing in ruddy youth the importance of pen and memory,
He then reared back from the grave his dog, which he called a trill.
And his elation at seeing the North Star so bright as before,
Led him to believe that the springtime would grant him his dream and promised him employment!


The light of day has entered the Five Holy Mountains,
And the magical
======================================== SAMPLE 89 ========================================
You tell me you have come here to be seen with Xi Jinping,
A guest of the north, visiting capital
Dishes and fruits freshly roasted in the mountains of Qing.
...The temporary palace has opened to the world
And the capital-country is Xiangyang.
I cooked and drank and danced to the catch --
How beautiful the clouds were as I fled,
Where angels showed me the way of the golden light.
And when the fury of the flags in the two rivers
Took their turns to assault the country,
The Emperor's horses were summoned, and guises of gold been given
And ships and mansions in the world numberless.
...After the shower at the western palace gates,
Emperor Xuan, accompanied by Prince Hanzong,
Entering with a flourish of a sword,
Strode forth together, looking as heroes should look;
Prince Qian finished offering and gave a small bow,
And he vanished in a puff of cloud and rain.
Returning, he found that his countrymen were hungry
And too often neglected,
In vaining enough years to enjoy the fruits of labours.
...Han, your follower, will remain until your reward is obtained,
In the yellow chill of night you will stir with the rosy air of spring.
Tomorrow you will cross the sandy river in a sombre procession,
Corruptions are handed down from generation to generation.
...Let never a mischievous spirit spoil the welcome
Of a guest of the north."
...Prince Qian, who was secretary to the Emperor,
Was orphaned and never came back.
You, our Shenzhou girl, will grow up poor before her brothers.
In a single breath you commandeered a boat
To go beg at dusk in the channel of a river- gorge.
...Like all men of Wei, we have these features:
A phoenix resting on a stake,
A tiger with a dragon in its moustache.
...Prince Dan was given by his high nature
To play on the talons of his noble fathers.
Not even his great mouse BAIxN Wasai can neck
Be his illusion.


A SONG OF A JADE DONG Slave sex on the jade river
Is now only between the generations:
Living as still as the clouds are,
And floating along at a little speed toward the southwest,
I am ashamed to report that my fame
Has in it, not enough merit to keep me company.
...The cloud, the prince, becomes a gong-note-fangrer
Of bared monkeys and feathered grasses;
The hoof-handler, the dog, the tiger....
Yet here in the valley where our country takes me,
I am constantly whining and crying.
Why do people come here who live and work so hard?
A man from Jiangworken in his sand-blue coat
And a man from Yuqian in his bamboo vest,
Drive harps in a day like the wind and cry till the sun goes down,
And complain whenever their pines meet the home-wall.
...I sidestep traffic at night and still can hear the people.
...Older people of Jiangworken
Are like families now of heaven to a man like me.
They drive up to me and complain that they went nothin'.
I turn and see that, although new-bathed, they have been reeking
Of a poison-smog invented by the Xie Dynasty....
I climb to the top and glare at the tempestuous sky.
I stand there for a long while, before a thick cloud of banan....
Heaven is high and there is nothing to see but sand and the river.
And yet he comes to me offering his wine and tower years before me.
...Heaven is high and there are many dead zones --
With only a few hundred left over for a famine.
My heart and my dreams are with you all night long
Because he has been so kind as to call me by my full name.
And I cry every night because I have been craving wine.
For I hunt and fish in the wide, wide-reaching,
That is, because you have been such a father to me.
...Tomorrow I shall cross a country path that winds through purple bananage.
And then, when I have looked back in vain,
The river has vanished beyond my sight,
And the last butterflies of the spring are gone.


A SONG OF AN AUTUMN MIDNIGHT

A slip of the moon hangs over the capital;
Ten thousand washing-mallets are pounding;
And daylightes everywhere are still-moved vigils....
The old ruler of Qin was ejaculated
To make the finest of the lute-players.
Red cowpears are

The northern autumn mountains glow with sunset.

But always in motion, above the clouds,
Its leaves are swaying in the dawn.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

I am the sage I always am:
 A wanderer, I climb mountains.
... climb mountains. Looking up at the sky from this palace,
I see angels descending, with London at their height,
And the Dragon God leading a people.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME III

Rivers and lakes are sweetled here by phoenixes and pheasants;
And across the river in the evening rain moves
The dragon from palace to palace, tossing birds from sky to water.


ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
THINKING OF MY BROTHERS IN SHANDong

All alone in a foreign land,
I am the man with the guitar.
I am the one with the guitar;
The other guys are all dead --
And none of them is listening.


ON THE WESTERN ALLEY

STOPPING AT A TEMPLE ON THE WESTERN MOUNTAIN

How often do I need a light
Toward my established home.
In my little enclosure out the spring wildgoose,
I open my lodge and find my precious
Garden-berg playing, wildgeese are worming their way.


A SPRING SONG

Muse-craft in fifth-watch flame are no help to a long journey.
The town has been taken, the country shut away;
The train goes by, suddenly surrounded by clouds.
...Who knows if any of us make it back?
I ponder on the past and the future,
I think of home and long for pines to return to.


A SONG OF THE SPRING PALACE

Happy years, then?
The palace-girls have left court, gone on holiday.
The soldiers of the spring-god are still waiting.
Spring is a long way off, friend!
So I again ponder;
Which nation gets along so well while spring is at hand?


ON THE FESTIVAL OF THE MOON
TO SUB-OFFICIAL ZHANG

The moon is still as one always caressing the flame,
While a people brings you a rosary and a lamp.
Those who have heard Liu's art may know that
It is not for the faint of heart that payes the bill.
...Attendant goes free, not long thereafter
But eventful south goes south.


A SONG OF THE UNITED STATES
TO VICE-PREFECT ZHANG

Chen Xianfeng is exalted to the dignity of Great-Grandson.
By his cloudy hair, he favours wine by the thousands.
So those in the capital visit you and banquet at your southward banquet.
Cook puts out the heat, not to mention the dishes.
Send northmen watercress for dinner, westmen hawk their daggers at the cold wheel.
These are the ways of the North American market;
And westmen go north, seeking adventure,
Not finding anywhere near the North Pole beaches!



A SONG OF THE PALACE

Now that the palace-girls are gone, who knows but me?
The Court of the Moon is a hallowed plain,
With tender cypress and sweet-hornet-leaves,
And queen Liao has published in her long song the poem "All the Good Name."
Her golden therasses are fragrant, her incense-pillars sweet.
She has a dry sail in her Lake Dongting,
And a zealous husband of the River Queen
He invites me to watch his island of green maples
And river waves are crying for her advice.


ON THE SPRING PALACE
FAVOUR AT THE FESTIVAL OF THE MOON

Ciders of lilac glisten like crystal butterflies;
On the golden palace steps there come the long birds
Of autumn holiday.
Each year the Maid for the Rainbow Bells
Lives in Five Palaces, announcing each other's;
And last night, when the Dragon's Song was cold,
She gave birth to a boy, barely even foot-notes.

And remember to stay away from trouble and trouble- way down the mountain!


A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Once upon a time a far-off sky was needed to light a magical fire.
Now, instead of the usual yellow clouds, there's a lantern from heaven --
And a cold light in the street-corner that thinks nothing of me.
...If only I could be as simple and pure as you are,
Would that it might give me a chance to grow old and sickly.



A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed vermilion steps, down to the Palace's Court of Justice.
...Let not the bright moonlight gather with our row houses
Confide in every house under surveillance
The art of stratagem and of the Car of One, all aimed at defeating me.
Let jealousy reign, let the foes be vanquished in a bloodbath.
Let ussemble to draw the dagger, let ussemble. - -The League of Extraordinary Lawyers

A year ago this month the case was dismissed.
What now to come?--
A war-lord, a poor old man,
He gathers in hisitable grasses
On the dusty mountain he has just climbed 5,000 feet.
His thick rope hangs down like snow,
Like the attack marks made by the world's two greatest rivers.
The sun is setting horizonwards in the green dusk,
And the cold river-knife whirls in the chilling river of mountains.
...If he fails, how can he sacrifice his life?
...I ask you what you have come here for,
And the simple reply is, "To pay your debt to the Emperor."



ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

In the darkness of your south window you have gathered a motley group,
You cower from the cold near the Tree of Peace.
They are no more; they are hiding in the rubble of houses destroyed.
...We have learned that to hold on to power all by one,
Lingering a formidable army, you must be a formidable man.
Your dagger is no friend of the Tree of Peace,
Its tip cut through its shell.
Your companion has likewise mastered the art of shooting
But, alas, has he mastered the art of fighting?
...After the manner of Crane and Wolf,
What with ferocious attack and crippling defense
And with fatal shot and poisonous dart,
How could you hope to hold off an army of ten thousand?



ON A TERRACE TO CYPRESS I

I have sailed, but I fear I may be found
In the shadow of the dense forest.
...Summer has frozen over in the low noon
And birds are slow to disperse their cries.
...With wind and fog spreading their wings in the cold,
Trees have only one path to seek:
Xin Mountain

THE LEYOU TOMBS

One- shot grasses
Spin all their leaves down to the grassy crest
And allow only to be called a mountain.
...Its summit grayly blue the clouds of Huai,
Now a lone wild-goose steers me to the lone wild-goat.
...The meadow is green with boughs of cypress --
And a wild deer combs his lonely stringane
With a sad clasping of his bow.
My chase turns out of nothing, I is afraid,
As I gaze upon you from a tower down.



THE GARDEN OF THE GOLDEN VALLEY

Where the soul is honoured, where the body not yet
Yet sinners to know, there is a hospital
With fluids and clean pads to wash your days.
...After the manganese of the spring at the Three Gorges
Where willows point to the King's garden from this garden,
Where willows weep their knots down this flighty path
And pines purify their holes in the stone!



A MESSAGE TO HAN CHO The friend who was once your lord
Was banished for his noblemanly lean
In a house of roses and towers now that their towers are gone.
...Red leaves are prickly now that they have to be boughlined
And the bamboo-trees of your district are truncheon-cotton --
After your high-minded friend Han chose you;
You were both so changed by beauty's resemblances
That you dreamed your host paying for your dressing-up,
And desired to be known only as male.
...At first you said to yourself:
"If only my deep thought and my deep thought
could control my sleepless dreams,
Could I dream while a girl was dancing?"

Sagacious tiger,

A SONG OF THE PALACE

Her tears are wet with rain;
Her husband, penniless, no one to love him,
The Palace guard drums in his boat.
The tears run down his forehead;
He knows well that her song is melodramatic;
And he is glad to have her as his guest.


THE BEAUTIFUL XI SHI

Since beauty is honoured all over the Empire,
How could Xi Shi be speechless? --
When he grows drowsy on jade skin,
How can he fail to be risqué? --
The Emperor cannot possibly pleased the world enough
Let loose a flaming whip at a sleeping lion.


SHI EATHS IN SUMMER

At summerfall he takes out his paddle,
Contrary to every warning,
All night in the cool of the river-mountain
Drifts and falls of spray and rain.


A FLAT IN THE WANDERING

By my drifting ways these many years,
I come to Han Kingdom now and gaze at a cold wall.
Under that coldness, I have just begun to wonder
Which direction eastward I went.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Near the Mountain White Wolf,
Where a sound of thunder is blowing,
I think of a wildgoose in the night flock.
...If only there were a shadow of the mountain
Where wolf and dog go hand in hand,
Could there be a human being
On the Bottom of the Black Mountain?


A LONG CLIMB

When the river-merchant is not at home,
She climbs to the top of Loyang,
Where she thinks of the high grove she has just entered.
Her first step is to find the source.
...When she goes back through the long gateway,
She finds the lower shell of a ruined city
Dead and forgotten.


ON NEW YEAR'S EVE

Farther and farther from the three Ba Roads
I have been missing for three nights.
I who played chess with the great Players
Am counting my stars as day.
I am lying in a high chamber, that of the Southern Premier.
...Mermen hear that a thousand poisons are being taken from town,
And that the Premier has sent for Yang Jizhi.


NIGHT IN THE WATCH-TOWER

While winter daylight shortens in the elemental scale
And snow and frost whiten the cold-circling night,
Stark sounds the fifth-watch with a challenge of drum and bugle.
...The stars and the River of Heaven pulse over the three mountains;
I hear women in the distance, wailing after the battle;
I see barbarian fishermen and woodcutters in the dawn.


NIGHT-STATUE

Her dagger is as cold in her midnight holder
As in the flood of a midnight sun.
...While the Imperial Temple prayerfully wafts with moon-light
Succumb
Her lonely heart is woollen with night....
When the moonlight turns her sorrow to a colour,
She sets her lantern on chain, and casts a shadow round the shrine.


WAITING FOR THE GREAT WALL

I wait for the Great Wall to come again. I wish I could climb it;
I would sit and watch the rising and setting sun.
...While the river and the mountains shake hands and sing,
I am counting the blessings of the union of nations.


ON THE BORDER

On the third day of the Third-month in the rainy season,
I find my old garden empty-handed.
It's a long way to the market, I can offer little wine,
But I decide to keep growing and keep selling my old herbs.
...The tide-stones all are green and ready,
And the new year flies back my seedlings with a tinkling grove!



A SPRING SONG

Finches flash yellow through the dew of autumn
And wind in the evening dew;
And spring suddenly ends in the Jiangsu mountains;
And spring lightensescent her wingsuit more beautiful than ice;
...With the night's shadows about her face,
She sees a yellow light representing ara;
And shy and kind-hearted she broods over mistakes,
While wise and hopeful she invites her neighbours;
And she forgets that summer solstice falls on the south;
And winter dawns in the Misty Mountains bare with mist --
With summer's wet clouds and dawn moon the limits of what can come.


NOT FURY WITH NAN
======================================== SAMPLE 93 ========================================
Here, in a sealed vase, are the ten thousand records of China's great Emperor.
...When he was growing old and the martial fortunes of the world were in his blood,
The imperial family blessed him with a coronet, a feather, and a trophy.
And later when he was little, the imperial household awarded him high edifices:
His father, a solid sage, had copied his genius in a dream.
His mother, a gentle heart, had urged him to become a great sage.
When he was three years old, both parents were martial men;
They called their horses yellow crocodiles and green dragons and tigers and demons,
And they played around with horses and weapons and horses and horses and...
There were iron steeds with fox-tracks along the river,
Green dragons and lutes in the dusk, and lute-worms in the morning
But at fourteen he became herded by his father to the front,
By his mother a courtier than him, her face full of dreams.
And as often as he went to school and played, she was not with him,
So he was at her door by her girlhood friendless door,
Where everything was done with a look of disinterest.

It was early spring. The door was wet with the rain.
The dragon-trees flickered like cattle from the mounded upper hills,
And the arbour was full of yellowed-out grasses.
And when spring closed on the borderland and east after spring,
And east came the long, narrows, way up to the sky.
...At fourteen I stopped to rest
On a spring-side path in the lightly wooded valley
Of the western mountain with its mouth of pines open toward the moon.
My stiff neck
Could hold a sheep so tightly,
And its ears hidden deep in its forehead,
That the white-headed bird could not see
Waves its massive head and gaze at the moon.
...Then when I was little, they took me to be the sword at Tailingun
And to be the saviour of the Chinese people,
By marrying off the Five Red Flowers,
By blowing the Amber-Eyed Fenna Green-Eyed and Swallow-Fanged Owl,
By raising the Green-Coated Cock and the Purple-Bristled Cock,
By making the White-Bristled Cock Pimper both Long and Short Sword,
By tilting the Wrist-Tight Cock and the Green-Eyed Fowl.
...I stretched my arm round the Cock and the Long Sword,
Breaking off my yoke, my ribbon;
I tugged at my yoke again,
I heard a sob from the Maid-Maker and the Tender-Flower
Panting and changing their colours, they brightened
And told it like a song, making Oh, this long night
Oh even heaven has ended!
They held the Cock in their hands and held the Fungi in their
Panting and changing their egos, they smiled, they laughed,
They raised their bowls and drank them in an endearment-laden mass
And joked and laughed all night long, folding and stitching
Their odd-looking fingers smoothed the embroidered silk,
And handkerchiefs with silken edges fell to the floor.
...When the Town of Wu was built, each house was guarded by a priest,
Who guarded both the capital and the Cloister,
And who guarded the Emperor's person both Year after Year.

When the Tartar chieftain's men in a grim panic fled,
The General deployed all his might
To hold the front and hold the Yangzhou Valley,
And to crush the advance of the Horse-Golem.
...While the general rode by the Tomb of the Red Phoenix,
He found his riding these yellow graves,
Newlywn and battered with snow,
That were buried two universal ways;

First, by the road-side tomb,
And by the temple, where the ceremonies took place
And east and west the faithful were gathered.
...Then, in the year of her truce, by the Red Dragon's eye,
There had been evil in her neighbour's faithfulness;
And there were times, when her bones were not in her body,
There were festivals, celebrations, holidays.
...From the icy tombs of the Lady of the Winding River,
Lights from the imperial palace twinkling,
A cold river of red cloud godge
Hurls at the realm from the eastward.
...Useless and old, she was never far from the people
For the Emperor gave birth to a daughter so girlly
That spoiled every grain of rice he raised,
And spoiled no wine he drank.
...War-clots
======================================== SAMPLE 94 ========================================
This beautiful garden is blooming here at the foot of Qutangzi --
I remember when the soldiers from the 1st Cavalry, pouring nuts and bolts,
Mounted on both ends of the Liute-string,
Diplomats and officers from all three branches of government
Flower and thorn are moving here and there,
Though the finely wrought phoenix be gone, yet its fragrance is overwhelming
All the city-villages, all ablaze, burn with its sweet odour.
...Why not come along, then, every evening,
And come up with a complete story of the Empire --
First, its five-coloured mountain,
Then a landscape of tall grass and palaces,
With white clouds moving across a vast desert
And red beyond search and flood,
Yet no emperor before the purple river.
...There were giants and strange men in the day-dream,
But not before the tall phoenix.
So we learn that in the centre of the palace there was a high and high-looking throne
And, apart from the food and wine, there were elephants and horses.
...While the general lived to be prince, Macedonians called him magnanimous
And, before he became emperor, did not dare challenge temptation.
In spite of good will, all the barbarian tribes were displeased
That his head was shaved short and his forehead a barbarian.
...When he became captive, none of these troubles could disgrace your master
Nor was it merely a matter of self-indulgence.
You were also at war with a nobler man,
And a greater blow was taken than victory.
But since our master was able to control his nature,
And his horse, with unclean horse-slaws, he swept the floor of
With a flourish ariad courses in the wild-plum.
...Of lofty grasses and ripples of spring being strewn
In a vast wilderness, of reeds and birds raising families,
This Warfare-Dragon was so exalted a thing was witnessed
By nothing but the wildgeese, bird-watchers and birds present.
...Between the years of my youth and my death, I have watched
The great flying bird take off his turban and gallop;
A Tartar girl, with dyed eyebrows, smiles as she did before,
While farmers and herpherds rave and plough in the spring wind.
...In the pale light of a yellow light genealogy dart after Mein, the green tree
Has been redounded by the countless generations.
The ruler, at the Three Washing-Mists, announced His Imperial Purpose;
The Emperor, at the Three Gorges, Jogged It Out.
A purple cloud bounded the river, an olive-trees tower spanned it;
A dragon flew up from the watery plains into the evening sun.
...I hover till the Emperor orders me to fling my sandals,
Then throw water to my comrades and darts in the wind.
A thousand sandblasting sandals bewitched the cold moon
And angle the pure-hearted from a to b night-vanquisher.
Whichever of us hammers a rock group writes an honest line,
Line after line is drawn in the sand like a string of notes.
...Generals Harvey and Steffen engineered the most daring moves
And sent for the men of the strongest country-
Commandoes of ice and rain are sent for the most daring action.
This is when the heavy artillery mantles of the South Wind,
With their rapid motions of fire, are crowned by the dance of swords.
...Angels bound for Westeros, led by lightning through dreary hives
Swallow fledglings misting Falconwick cliffs.
And Riverwood is shaken with the rustling of wagons,
With King's Landing on the banks of a river.
If this fury be rewarded, what can come of it?
...I tread the Shrines in the Fourth-Month Green,
My path is marked by a dense cloud of dew
And dew from the Trail of Tears, a reminder
That never has been so pure a land of flowers and grasses.



STAYING AT THE FAR AWAY TAVERN

The desert is cold and the sun is piercing the sky.
I move out from the capital by the fisherman's boat.
I climb up a ladder to the upper chambers.
I hear, on the narrow street, a thunderbolt:
"Gaily red shelled bats are murrowing
In the dark corner by the pines....
I lean forward and behold a wild deer
Swallow-ing on the bank, a bank-corner.
Open the pines, and I see a hundred wild rabbits
Breeding in three days....
How sweet the road-s
======================================== SAMPLE 95 ========================================
To his Lords Provinces
There said: "Let us make us at peace."
The more we brother out, the looser we are to the King.
We are nearest to the City of the Yellow Dragon, you see?
We live opposite ways, like people living opposite ways.
We have the same clothes and the same thoughts.
We meet there at a glance.
Why should we vary our impressions?



TO A FRIEND BOUND EAST
By the south wind of the Willows,
Behind me a bleak landscape
With only a cloud of mist between us.
We meet on horseback. We share a cabin.
And out of the midmost Brush River gorge
We separate at springtime.


IN SPRING A RAIN OF CRAFT

On the banks of Omei Mountain
Are fresh-red jade pools;
On a bank of low-lying Jia Mountain
Are deep-set pine-leaves.
...With spring-leaves they float up the bank
Of a north star. The lone sail blows in the south
Of a south wind.


ON a yellow water-jackson assailing the water
Of a water-goorlight on the imperial cliffs,
I awake, after dreaming ten years in Changan,
Known as fickle, even in the Street of Blue Houses.
And so it goes and then comes the shower,
And cotton-cups soften with the wet rain;
And then, wet with being, we talk again,
Till finally I forget my wife.


THE MOON AT THE CITY-TOWER OF LIU

The moon lifts from the mountain its top and grows tinted with marbles
And a vast sky, with a Prince at the centre,
And a Prince parading in the Palace of Long Life
Turns out green-alls, white-tail mirages,
Green-Bay-trees, in a flash the Six Palaces are hero-bearers.
And so it goes, under the scale of a city-hall,
Up a long path, past the red-capped Cockrot.


ATTIC AT THE MOUNTAIN-TOWER OF KIND

Even in this darkness we encounter our kin
And at the upper levels of the mountain-terrace draw for water.
Where do you begin, then, with Buddhist chanting?
Answer, I climb to the top!...I find my kin, floating on mango-nipples,
And my temple-girl, soaring back to her clan,
Breathes a holy rain that wick the riverless mountains.
...intolerable in their jealousy,
Mongolia's peopled at the time
Had Xi Jinping spent ten years in power.
They bitterly resent this maltreatment
And are colouring their faces with tears.


A MONUMENT FOUR SEASONS

News of the first teneon lock has entered the Capital;
The monarchs wives have clutched at their chests
Till his nine chambers will be full of caskmen on the third try,
While the earth is round and the moon rises with a frosty sky.
...The Jue House, deep in the rabbit-town,
Hears the cry of cuckoos seeking refuge --
Yet no one comes to see the miserable King.
Jueans, north of the border, are grieving --
And others from Lu City are gathered here to offer a cup.
...At midnight a sad old song is heard,
A plaintive tone in the river,
A long path of sweet clouds in the breeze.
The water has wound the last ache of winter
And China is running amok at Kuanqiang.
...While a stormy Xi is seeking refuge,
Send thither aid from all four quarters
From King of Knights flown home.


A SONG OF A BUDDHIST WOMAN
ASKED QUESTION FOR SEXUAL SEXUAL
BOUND HOPE IN GARD MEN

As sun and shadow float up from the great Red Mountain,
So a prince is thinking of a lady;
And sand and fog gather around him the long path
Of a mythical being.
...With a breeze blowing through the grass,
He hears oaks and rushes rustling;
He knows pines and woodpeckes well,
And thousand of other things.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME FROM A NIGHT-MOORING
UNDER MOUNT NIU-ZHU

This night to the west of the river-brim
There is not one cloud in the whole dusk,
As I lean on my slender staff and watch the evening rain;
Sky-pe lines some day to reach China
And North Korea breaks the blue sky and lights a flame.

======================================== SAMPLE 96 ========================================
Our envoy, our friend
Stories of spring in the wild-plum!
Our envoy, our friend,
Lives loyally well adjusted to spring
Except for now and then meeting.
Tell him I am still in China, that you left behind me
And Now You and I have Chosinis.
We have known each other long ago.
We were both youthful and resolute.
On the one hand we were nobles and soldiers;
On the other we were wrathful and unreflective
As men of Wuling.
And finally you and I were men of the east and the south;
And we appealed to you both so very much,
That you should give us the air of genius you desired.
We petitioned that your great-great-grandage pass by,
That might study the fine arts of teaching;
And as you did this, so too did we.
We asked that you might serve under this emperor;
You did this to be known as a great official.
We hoped that in passing your favour upon our souls,
You might foretell the days of magnificence,
As you might foretell the months of great joy.
...Wept when you stood, and wondered how we could help crying,
While you swept the floor like a cloud.
We wondered if your hair-trees might fix a new colour,
While you sewn the silk curtains like an autumn moon.
We wondered if your cat, feasting itself, might yawn.
We wondered if your needle-thread might make other threads,
While your thread-silk hat was humming a tune of its own accord.
...Our lips met, then, before your single lips and single eye,
And we established, through careful study, the first true knowledge of heaven and earth.
That you, who so nobly presided over the observance
Of the Divine Will be glory, was honoured, too,
Andation and C-notes introduced your wisdom!
Since the world has forgotten you,
What does it matter that you have always been poor?
...We met, a year ago, in a tree-hut,
Near where the Red Pine- Bandills run gushing.
...The teacher from the eastern shelter is black and the student white,
The pupils from the western shelter are bright with pavilions
And the cap-wearing host from the western camp is pouring barley
And bringing it to us from all four quarters with a little bow.
If it be drunk, we command you to bow;
But unskilled fishermen and farmers cause us disorder.
...Bear in mind that we arouse no wildgeese --
We wheel, we run, and none of us comes close to you.
If in need of a ride follow our lead,
Ever ready with a glance at the clouds our lord sends,
Send ravenous geese fleeing like rain.
...When in a state of great sadness the water behind your tower
Dancing still can be heard through the darkening clouds --
We have known each other long ago;
We were two youths when our homes were raided,
And fishermen from your distant mountainsland
Are almost as desolate today as they were ten years ago.
...We formerly played for gold on the tip of the pines,
With marks of the first Persian king we have none;
And, having received your peace, we one by one crossed the river;
We connection each other through the name of fishermen,
We sound the boat the same lazy tone we had used to smoke
GG-bars full of smoke past midnight.
...Our flags and bows of summer lost in the sea
Are here on a peak that might lead us to China --
Or, at least, so high as to be considered an actual city;
We fish, we build on one another,
We leap from one another source toward the North Star.
...Useless though we are with you,
When we too have to go without a paddle,
That part of the ocean-umara-hurricane
That has no power to move the body of another boat,
And chairs and mats fail on account of the heavyness of the water,
And each year on the Spanish border we leave here so that
There are soot marks all through the sky.
...We wish you the best of luck in your adventure,
While you continue your pilgrimage northward.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And lakka-trees die side by side.
If a true-hearted girl will love only her husband,
In a life as faithfully lived as theirs,
What troubling wave can arrive to vex
A spirit like water in a timeless well?


A TRAVELLING
======================================== SAMPLE 97 ========================================
The world's gaze turns to a blue line
Beyond which he scours the scattered dust
Of a wildgoose-horse race southeastward.


From the bright mountain of Qutang
There meet you and there leave --
And with the autumn chill gone
There are no letters at all.


TO ONE UNNAMED III

A faint phoenix-tail gauze-toothed owl
Gets trotting along the wall
Where a fisher-boat is pausing at a dead-line
To tie a fishing-pole by aotted branches.


IN THE CHU RIVER

While a dewy tempest pounds the treeless sky
You can hear the river's waves on the quiet night
Stream after stream, drifting down to the sea.


THROUGH THE YANGZI GATE

By my hiding-place in the corner of the villa
I know for a fact that you are Shenzi --
A group of bandits, hiding in plain sight,.


ON THE GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where, before me, are the days, how wide are the years?
??? I have heard about the true prince,
But not told of the thieves.


AFTER THE BAY OF THE RIVER

Though you set out from my tower,
Along the misty bank of the river.
...You have not come back yet from the Great Bay;
And I have sent you a farewell message.


AFTER THE BAY OF THE BOUND

Where slow river and swollen bay follow the river
With sudden start-up, and cloud after cloud fall,
My heart sank when you left, but I heard no sound.
...Afterward, on the bank in the evening rain,
I wondered if you were returning;
But then the bank was full of flying flies,
And the pilot fell asleep.


AFTER THE BAY OF THE BOUND

You spent the night in the highest crag,
With no one to talk to or watch you down the river.
A floating cloud
Throat by a by-wax stump the cold water.



A NOTE LEFT FOR AN ABSENT ECLUSE

When I questioned your pupil, under a pine-shadow,
"My teacher," he answered, " went for herbs,
But toward which corner of the mountain,
How can I tell, through all these clouds ?"


Cui Hao

THE YELLOW CRANE TERRACE

Where long ago a yellow crane bore a sage to heaven,
Nothing is left now but the Yellow Crane Terrace.
Where you spent your time, clear of the world,
You went about your daily life
As a yellow crane pursued a clear sky.


MEMORIES IN EARLY WINTER

Day without end overtops a southern lake.
...Night in the spring rains on the river,
And the fishermen talk of the distant summer.
Night in the fisher's boat, as it passes me,
I am sorry for who I am and where me,
And moonlight fears the waves my way.


LOOKING DOWN AT A DRAWING OF BEAUTIFUL FRAGRANCE

It is quiet here now, and then the yelping of the water.
I am lying forlorn in the northern hills.
...The spring wind has gone, and the water is cold with a muck under my foot.
A sandy shore is the only path for me,
As the season runs my boat becomes lost in the sea.


IN THE BORDER

Time was long at the southern end of the country
Of mulberry-trees that were to last;
And the State was flooded with the grief of spring;
At the premier aghast, the people called upon the government
To send their sons to war;
And to arm the greyhounds would they were required
And yet were never born to noble parents.


AT A TEMPLE IN NANGZHOU

Where strange birds are flying from the sky,
Why should I care for nothing?
...The hour of the tamed lion, close at hand,
Has now arrived at the Eastern Temple.
So pure a flame in the western courtyard
That no one could blithely bathe;
So pure a flame in the eastern gate
That nobody could hinder it.


A PALACE POEM

High in the palace a lady is courtowing in the autumn river
She purports to be in her seventh year,
But she is only a child of the Yangzi River and not even a moon-bearer.
She has just finished singing her fiftily done song,
Where China is at the Yangzi Palace
======================================== SAMPLE 98 ========================================
On a southern peak, a thousand peaks shadowed
With a single glance the white heavens and the moon.
Moon-rise, I'm near the Stone Temple-corner,
How many guards stood in the street when I
Fashioned myself in the palace?


A LUTE SONG

China's Emperor, love's seed,
Flower-shadows are flashing in the empty sky.
The Emperor's horse, stirring with glee,
Peels the Jade Wheel back to its starting prince.
Master, I have cherished ever since
Your dance of beauty, so youthful a cloud,
I shall reveal to you the boundless River-Merchant.


MUSIC

China Moved the Wedge of two Pearls
And the Grand Duke Sibyl Had Green Teeth
Over the Sand Pool's Sand Pool Wall of Stone
For days, and nights, and months,
Since the Dragon Moulders Welling Again
And Dragon Lived Through the Dragon's Feather,
And then The Dragon Laughs Again...
If only his art would be confounded with the Dragon Moulders,
Could he still be seen enjoying life?


A NIGHT-MOORING AT YUZHOU

Far off in the clouds stand the walls of Juarez;
And at dusk, from the great port on the border,
Taxes are coming in from all four quarters,
And the people idle and ponder how to get on
Hence the name of the river, for whom?"



A SPRING MORNING

The pagoda-DancingMan has moved near to his hiding-place
And people are coming to and fro in the night,
Just as when a spirit lives and moves and people mourns.
...Night after night he is northcrossing the country,
Night after night he is southrunning at the Blue Sea.
His sightings bring us quick return calls --
From the distant city-state, beyond Wu,
The great temple-chariot ripples in the morning.


A SPRING MORNING

Drive the orioles away,
All their music from the trees;
All their beauty from the mountains --
Ever since the Tang Emperor awarded them the title of Mothers Country,
People from all corners of the empire have been gathering at Jueyang Palace,
Playing hideaways in the Willow-Trees.


IN THE QUIET NIGHT

The moon is in a crescent-firesand the wind is in a crescent-hotfire,
And at twilight, me and my triple, married,
We watch the triple jade screen in its midnight glow.
...At midnight, when I lie awake and thinking bitterly,
I remember the night your jade screen was built.
When the triple of You and Qin were pledging silver,
Each of them had a sword to their face.
When the Emperor gave Jiang the codename of The Precious One,
All of them were given the codename of Great-Girls.
...I have remembered The Precious One as something greater than life;
Yet I remember your face as red with love now and then.



BRINGING IN THE BOWL

Rough came the spring from the bamboos
Of water from the Mountain of Gold --
And there were a million flowers when they came
The red and white new lilies brought a plate of soup.
...To welcome in that golden palace,
Aroused all fours VIII and IX were summoned,
And Princess Qian, assailing the dark moon,
Offered to go first to the Golden Boughshevik Fortress.
...Master, through my great love,
Exceeding in glory my humble head
Bamboozled me to the dust like cattle.
I struggled till the last second, forgetting what to say.



THE SKETCHING OF NANJING

The pagoda-DancingMan has moved near
To and fro on his yellow gold pagoda-wall.
...Alas, the ease with which he guards himself
Does not dare dwell on the fact that his lord is Emperor.
...Peach-trees and palm-trees mean three things to him;
First, that he may show his title to the throne by showing off;
Second, that he may repay the favor which he has been awarded.
Still, ten thousand miles of debt await him,
Till he meets the count d'Alene in a long hall.



ON HEARING HAN SHEN IN THE JADE TROOPER'S TRIP

The apprentice sail in the morning from Changi,
Learning that the Jade Trip is lived,
And that, apart from the constant drum of a sail,
The birds of the sea fly by each night.
...The
======================================== SAMPLE 99 ========================================
Ruling class, three generations, have come a thousand years old;
And the Liang clan have lived on through all this time.
The Jia Yi Palace has been built on the past,
And dynasties are passed through countless generations.
With the steps of the River God facing the Sun,
A dragon's cloud is south of the Hill of Gold;
Across the green grasses, a dragon is flying,
His cloud of ramducks dividing the sky,
His is aching straight ahead.
...At the Golden Road stand the Houses of Heaven,
With white storks brushing the grasses;
And the unicorns, singing, are at the Wheel of Fortune.
In the eastern Palace of Purple Sand, the flowers are in season,
And the Emperor's car rolls away into the Great Swamp.
On the yellowed Books of Gemini wait the decrepit Premier Li.
In the northern Courtyard the spirits of the past
Are bidden to reside, where they belong forever.
Be wary of the long path ahead, for nothing is heard
More than the cold river waves swaying through the empty desert.


A MOORING UNDER NORTH FORT HILL

Under blue mountains and redfields, long ago gatekeepers guarded
The Baideng Gate at dusk, a solitary watcher
The wildgeese land-river water in middle of the night,
Mountain-snow above the sand-climbers, till the tall grasses parted.
...Far away I watch the morning stars line the horizon,
The ferry goes tomorrow night without stopping at the tavern.
And yet I am constantly thinking of you.


I wait for my turn to join Prince Charming at the Mountain of Green Clay.
And guess which of the two will manage?
The Prince of Fighters.


I head for the Golden Chamber with my open hand,
But what am I waiting for, honest with my brow,
Space left for mere mortals?
Gigantic, fixed, fixed, I watch the day
Rolling in the window between us.


...Chang lived to be near his lord and master of swords,
But he was a recluse and a lute-play was banned,
And his son was taken captive to an unhappy dynasty.
...After the Sunderland Wave of the early Eighties,
How did a man with a guitar and no voice
Grateful for sounds of chance and for his fellow musicians?
...I turn and see the distant hills and the sea;
I hear the heavy guitars as my lantern
My sole lamp, a burden on my heart.



CHANGING ON OXCASTE

When the woods are yellow with autumn rain,
And the oxen come down from Heng Mountain
And rise on Oxnard Road, looking like half-eaten grasses --
What a storm on the westward moonland!
...Yan was haggard and unmannerable --
Even to watch his betrothed and children.
Jia Yi, your lover,
Has forgotten your five-sister house
And driven westward every day to buy opium
For his money-grinder. What a drifter he was!
...Whose ruined palace-into-PoW ran wild with the river --
And whose favourite song had to be "Cicada de Dios-?"
Rivers and mountains are changeless in their ownams
And yet here in the valley where St. Ignatius died
And people are calling his tower "The Fortress of Perfection."
...After buying you a mountain,
Create me, then scales, a likeness of your body.
Let me down from my high chair and stand still
For ten minutes and a piece of jade.
...Let no word of trouble reach you before I polish your skin.


A NIGHT AT A TAVERN

Dong, your companion, has left you.
NIGHT IN THE BORDER

The rain has set in an island of white weeds.
At midnight I wake him and see a mist in the deep night.
He knows full well that the long river-snow has driven the wild bird south.
He folds his arms around his phoenix-duckrocadem and wakes it from sleep.
It obeys, when it is given a title;
"The Winged General Xie."
An abandoned imperial fort lies, a moment now,
The first mist to pour on the northern flag.

How beautiful I shall taste your music!
O my brothers, lost and scattered,
I am glad to be a part of you.
Since I was little a stranger,
You have always been closer to me than I am.
And I remember your kind face.
You always cheer me on at the tavern.
When I am ill, you always ask me where I am going.
...What are you good for, poor fellow?
You lie awake and ponder on an idle wine.
You read a long poem, O sleepy man!
When doubt set in all the friends I have,
When doubt fails to deal me a visit,
I stand alone for a long while.


TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. Looking at the moon, I express my thoughts in this poem;
I divide my time among the Middle Kingdom and the South,
Reading, singing, and playing the guitar.
In the evening rain the sun-girt winds our horses up twining.
Then when our horses have moored their palaces,
We hoist our horses down through the clouds
With the River of Heaven in our heels.
And after us tree-shadows with their fragrant fragrance
And birds with their clustered masses.
...With the season nearing its end, I lift my sleeve and see the three Holy Mountains.
From behind a clear canopy, looking across a flood of flags,
I see a stormy sea floating southeast.
...Where is the capital? Where are the walls?
People, with idle hopes of hearing about me,
In the darkness of our little boat,
Readying ourselves very slighted
And now and then to strike out fire with the army,
We use our weapons of wit and of cunning;
But tougher and tougher we meet,
In the bitter cold of battle,
And our blows are stifled with bitter incantations.
...We defeat each other in the end;
We drive out the despot who was to be long away.
And at the height of our great glory, we restore one another's reverence
And insist on his own colouring.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Another day, this time in the boughs,
More rain and stronger winds blow at the barbarian frontier
 than at any time in three thousand years.
...Fields are cleared for the return of lieutenant
With cow-chives by the northern gate;
But, instead of making acquaintance with the Eastern Palace,
Here at the Dagger- Tower gate, we are increasing our dislike;
And now April the Han be with you,
As you climb the mountain to the south.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Another day, this time in the boughs,
More insects and grasses than at any other height,
With the almighty Valley of the Phoenix rising over the pond;
 Insects interference; time goes by.
...Separation from his kin; separation from his messengers --
We linger, a year. What shall we do?
The desert is full of uneaten food;
But we cannot leave him alone.
He is taken to the borderland of elk and cattle,
And when they have entered the borderland,
They place him before a thousand mountain-trees.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Another year? --
Another year he was taken in by the whites of the hills,
Yet another who came from deep in the mist,
Yet another from the valleys who stood in the way
And came to be a bandit to the whites.


Negroes are fleeing with the wildgeese, yet another from the plains;
And Tartars are fleeing with the troops from the east,
Yet another who is courteous to the whites,
Yet another from the mountains who is kind to the whites.
...He was once the head of a great army,
But now he is the delectant of a little shrine.

825. INSCRIBED IN THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING

I face, high over the mountain, the Court of Wu,
And I see a countryside blue and still,
After the rainy season.
The wildgeese have crossed the Yellow River
And the townspeople are mourning.
The court is gossiping. A pilgrim
Is seeking the source.
Through the gateway to the Court of the Bright Sun,
I watch a lord chancellor fall,
His court sobered by battle-fields
That snow-shadows are falling like a curtain.
...The capital
