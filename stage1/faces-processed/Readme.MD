Raw faces run through a set of artistic filters. Using:
1. GIMP 2.10
2. Alessandro Francesconi's BIMP (which allows for easy batch processing) https://alessandrofrancesconi.it/projects/bimp/
3. The 'Conte' script from http://www.gimphelp.org/artist_conte.html


Note: I screwed up a little with image(19).jpg and image(18).jpg - they're identical in the raw files folder. This version has been corrected by substituting another face for image(19).
