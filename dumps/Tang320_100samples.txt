======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
Generals Chuangzi Mubarak and Xi Jinping lived happily ever after,
With rare visits to the palace and rare visitors.
But in days of peace there came a sort of terror in the dawn.
Those in the west, watching the great palace,
But forgetting the great leader, turn to heaven
For support.
Those in the east, hoping for a better leader,
Still in the west, wishing for only this terror,
Wecut out the wings and used them like banners,
And showed them to the whole of heaven,
And showed them to all neighbours,
And encouraged their reluctant adoption
There. were even siblings: one brother and one sister.
So tall is the imperial canopy, so wide is the void
That a featherweight horse might not graze its horsebrokers.
War-torches through the city-gate, wildgeese are flying homeward over Lake Dongting.
A stone to the breast of Emperor Xuanzong reads:
"Friend, I have need of you.
...Let's talk again-then share the wine."


TO VICE-PREFECT LU

There is a gleam of green in an old bottle every time someone asks you where you were born.
You were a renowned person of the night,
A man of the eastern border towns . . .
Who, raising your head from a sofa,
Tells the story of the Bright Sun,
As seen from the three Qin districts.
The banners and the flags of the Ruler of Heaven were the same,
And the people were fond of riding to and fro
With the days and the months the same as theirs.
And so most of us, in our early forties,
Are exalted to do great things,
But what about those who are still at the southern border?
...There are other people in our neighbourhood, yet we too are lowly
And lazy to go back to our houses and eat our fish,
We stooped low and smoked our pipe and swept the sand,
We drank our wine slowly and languidly through the quiet rain.
...If only our low birthrates were as great as those of the Qin Kingdom?
...Or continue down this road into the mountains of Huazhiki?
Let loose wildflowers in a storm of passion
And strain away at will the heavy branches!



A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the Temple of the Great Premier stands an ancient cypress
With a trunk of green bronze and a root of stone.
The girth of its white bark would be the reach of forty men
And its tip of kingfish-blue is two thousand feet in heaven.
...With the corner of my two-horn sword barely a step apart
And the round tip of a tiger's tail barely a tip of a hundred,
I have ridden this ancient walled-off river three thousand miles.
And the water's headlong stride dilutes my ears;
But I hold my breath for another rider, and hold my breath for ever
That the tumble of the last wanderer I know.



A SONG OF A WANG FAREWELL

The girth of its tip one thousand fingers…
Is it not disgraceful that wise people of Tang are bound to discern
How sage-seers recite Confucian wisdom?
Not even Confucius can compare his lofty peak
With that of the wiser and fitter men;
Yet not even King Harakatong of China learn to read and write.
And King Kongathill of Hongkong learn neither dance nor song?
If he be learned, how can he glory?
And so Harakatong evolve not dance nor song,
But flight and swiftboat.



ON THE MOUNT HAN OF THE OLD CYPRESS

Where Bismuth was born, where the palace was built,
Where the colour of the year be divided into nine districts,
I have often visited the well-known Southern Palace,
Where flowers and colours are introduced, following the fashion of the spring,
To be accompanied by the luminous mist of dawn.
And so open the pines and view the southern mountains,
With its ashrams and whirlpools of lake and sand.
Be wary of the Keeper of the Bright Sun, friend of the Capital of Heaven.


ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

I was appointed courier to the capital of Lewes
And courier-boy brought you a plate of cinnamon-notes,
A plate of jade-white barley-nine strings,
A golden cord and, with the hook of a dragon's thunder,
A bamboo- flock and a harp separated by the underwood.
And when I reached the capital, I found that the people were sweeter
And my escort fairer than in
======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================
But alas, for wine, for hero's sake?
Drink, O Prince of Friends, and enjoy life!
Since I was able to send you these ten thousand coins,
I have given away many a good glance.
Be wary of a great power, remember, who will pay?



BORDER-SONGS III

High in the faint moonlight, wildgeese are soaring
With banners of eldritch fire.
If a war-song serve as your prop,
Send them soaring through the sky!


A SONG OF WAR-CHARIOTS

The barbarian horsemen of the North
Are spattered with blood here between Summer and War.
If you pledge me, I will give away.
Show off your weapons in a dance of starry hand
And coronets of half-seen Swords!


BLACKTAIL ROW

Grass has been cut off between the city and the mountains,
And a cold river meets Lake Dongting --
And a flowery path leads to the palace.
By the time I have crossed the southern wall,
I will turn to hunt for those who were stolen from me,
And to erect a bright flag in the River's waves.


A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Birds in the slant of the moon,
Servants of the Emperor, are checking
Mosses that is your greatness,
Each day hiss with feverish hunger on his fill.
If he bit not his sleep today, he was gone for ever.
Who knew that the flood of spring
And the spring-dragon Bala hadizza Thesaurusxes?


A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

I fear not, for the sake of speaking English,
That a barbarous conqueror
With no music to stir the water of the bay,
With his nine furlongs of wind hampered his horses,
And drums deaf to his screams!


A SONG OF LA VID HANYANG

The sweet of the flowers that were during the day
Was chilled by the cold of the desert sun,
And Yun and Liu were out riding homeward rides,
When a wildgoose bird daring a duck in its mouth
Dismounts on a sagacious young man its plum-darkening flight.
...Then when the King of China was fugitives,
He flew westward, landing in Hanyang,
Where he often lavished his time, so that the number of his birds didn't
Keep falling by His empty mountain.



HARD IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD III

The way is broad like the blue sky,
Not far in the middle of the night
From palace to palace, from hut to hut,
News from the field to the sea, fresh with morning rain.
...Yet that Jia was born
Still in such a state of affairs,
Could not nurs her first-rate baby,
So coax her into speaking to menciots
Till they would bury her and smithen their swords;
And still she wailed in the twilight,
With brook in its mountain-plum and pond,
As she rode she brushed her husband's bronze armour.



THE JADE POOL

Where even the finest pot-shots are vain,
Brown sand is a thousand rivers --
And out of the sky a girl poises
Like a flock of plum-trees and whose wings are wing-pan,
Sweet is her green wave at her fleeing father....
When she grows up and marries, she and her mates in the temple
Will be chosen from all the girls in the palace-hall....
When Buddha ended their tenures, there were girls in the palace
And one by one they shrieked and shriveled and fell,
Some of them as young as seven.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME
ON THE CHU RIVER

A cold light shines in the cold river:
Ten thousand peaks I ray my face,
And a tinge of grey in the shoreline
Which has left me only the silence of the river.
...After the battle of Yuyang, when grasses had no chance
And the mountain fragrant with duckweed,
My loneliness has left me no one to guide me.
I am so far away from the villages that singing will be hard
For days, even with the wind.


ON THE BORDER

Though a bugle breaks the crystal air of autumn,
Soldiers, in the look-out, watch at ease today
The spring sky; she would sweep the plain, she would hasten the autumn rain;
But there's a hero like her, a woman of the south,
Who lives by a wide stream, never to return.
She
======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
Grasses and Woods in Yinho are bright on the eastern horizon,
And grasses in Huai and Qin in the River of Stars
Come early this morning and drink from the Flow-Caps pink:
Monkeys and birds are still, out in the world,
As I stood beside your house three nights,
And then came a rain that dulled your lamp
And knocked my candle to a boil.
...Why so woman-kind in a day-warmer world
Who cuts feathers for feathers only to sow again?
...Night in your window and morning in the River-Sun,
Bluebirds flew with the warm spray of the lake;
And now and then, behind closed doors,
Will open and close an old door.
...I and a few companions made our way in;
And a while later I heard a drum and leapt,
I too, the guest, descending the ladder.
...The River of Green Jade rises to the skies above clouds and grasses,
And Eighth-month Loyang becomes a mountain-line --
By the Yangzi River loyally flying,
Our host, accompanied especially by his friend,
Here at the tavern, receives the wine.
He is small and frail and has to have tea;
And his companions roughen it up by pouring out cold glasses.
...Major General Li has confirmed your offer.
Show him your imperial flag, vent his anger!
Show him your flying Flying Robe, alarm him!
Show the Emperor your most sacred sword!
Show his loyal subjects boat-hailing often!
But always ready with macabre weapons,
Never ready with sobering expedients,
Why commanders fret so much about protecting a fellow sovereign!


SHE DRIVES IN ON A DRAWING BY A SAKURA
OF THE CAPTAIN SAGTHAT

Reporting late this morning from your post in the darkness,
There meet with one falling out among troops
Who, unhappy with his temporary post,
Adds that adventure calls for another!
...The Eighth-month North Star, growing darker
With each passing day, humbles the thinner its mountains!
...Sagothist wintry seaside towns abound
With the heavy snow that rises from the Doklam range.
Preparing me tea, Major General, assigned me.
Tell me, where you headed your army,
How light you swept my sandals so lightly
And how the Eighth-month South Star, rising with the rain,
Led an archer on a roller-coaster to his doom.
...The sandals had sounded their age,
And the soldier rode with his torchlight through the stormy sky.
But as King Kongared he to glory, to the Emperor there was no one left.
So he formed a tough band and marched on through the stormy clouds,
With his pair of horse plumed swords sharp and fast.
Then Tang General came along and told him your triumph;
And the ladies-in-waiting laughed joyfully at his tricks
And his gold coins rushed back home in golden coins.
...Do you mean to frighten the feathers away from your jade feathers?
Of old battles, with their single horses on wheels,
Or are they merely a game of chance,
Which has left the horses with the decisive battle?
...I paint an Eight-Flowered Rainbow Jade Dragon. What kind of battle are you hoping for,
AFTER YOU'VE LEARNED!


SPRING PALACE ANGLE

Flowers are shadowed, the palace darkens,
Birds twitter by for a place to perch;
Heaven's ten thousand windows are twinkling,
And the City of Silk tilts its golden clouds.
...If only a emperor lived, he might serve once more


In a reign of royal favours, of ladies favoured,
There would be nothing but white snow and beasts
And the desert, with its longitudes filled with rain.
...Flowers, in a boundle, precipitate all foreign travel,
Anderers of whisky risk falling ill with the White Wolf.
But this is life after death:
And it is not to be sullied with the ruddy Cenotaph.


A NIGHT-MOORING NEAR MAPLE BRIDGE

While I survey the world, looking northward,
I find lofty Lake Dongting
And the river that runs beyond it --
But a foot below I am met by mist and clouds.
...The cold moonlight branches metal barriers;
Cotton fits chaff, and bone-men idle.
I am passing, behind a fort, a war-hound;
But, sadder, than death, urges me to go.



A PURE-GNILEGES MESSAGE TO
======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================
The Chinese will be baffled
At how little The Great Eagle Wounded the three Qin Dynasties --
Up until this day he lived in peace
Under a cloud top with a ruined fort.
...The mountain at this point is called the Wall,
And every boat and carriage on it is blacked-out.
Darting, indeed, from the sacrifices,
The Emperor tagged along, with a laugh,
To watch the Jiangsu River come down.



POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

Even to contemplate this constellation of mountains and rivers,
Tears are still on the river stalaneaves
And the low moon sinks in the deep sea.
I am ashamed to be an empire expert
And to bear you such a burden.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME III

Since the Emperor awarded Great Helm to Zhou Chen in exchange for his services,
There have been rumors of twenty-two thousand marks.
...The notes have not yet been added to the rolls of a great kingdom.
My duty as high as the Taihang Mountains,
As strong as the Martial Qin,
Hasalysed my mind to think of Loyang.
...Monkeys and birds are gone, and I hear thundershot
Accidents are every day, and the Emperor has sent me
 Audience to behold in his endless sky
Beyond the white mountains of Bing
The desolate desert and the far horizon.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME IV

Since the Empire has worshipped her hands-down her beauty,
There have been incense-puff girls driven from their palaces
And decrepit princes from all five rivers.
...Mounted and decrepit, from the rain of Yuyang to the Dragon Pass disaster,
There are camps all along theriver for the Chinese to camp....
China is turning homeward-bound, and voyaging.
Preparing a new beginning, she sayth, with words of her heart,
She cruelly wonders where she is going.
Who is she making her cards for?
A Chinese boy from Huai -- that quiet boy from Youzhou
Who comes from the north to visit you.
Who tells you that his father-in-law is a Chu cutter?
He knows his way around the gold-plated sword,
Not even his great chieftain, the Chinese Emperor,
Whose fame has bred an insatiable appetite
For bloodshed and pure action.
Why not join him, friend of the Emperor?
Chu lives in peace with an inelven fort,
Yet cannon fires will never clean his lonely heart
And dust his lonely bed.


AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

After rain the empty mountain
Stands autumnal in the evening,
Moonlight in its groves of pine,
Stones of crystal in its brooks.
Bamboos whisper of washer-girls bound home,
Lotus-leaves yield before a fisher-boat --
And what does it matter that springtime has gone,
While you are here, Yu Baizyhi?


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME V

A cold wind blows down Yu Baizyhi in the mountains
And Jin Mountain-drifts endlessly.
...Night now yields to a desert where birds are gone,
And the desolate river-side is bare with the evening rain.
You, Yu, becomeagraic-cold: "O my brothers, lost-in-it all?
Who taught you to be mute and to be reticent
And to be seasonable only by your word?"


ON CLIMBING YAN MOUNTAIN WITH FRIENDS

When the gold is at its height and the colour of a sad moon,
Monkeys and birds are soaring homeward over the mountain
And the river Gao wildly leaps toward us.
....We know how to find your place;
But how can we take advantage of the bright moon?
We are scattered by yellow leaves in a sadland of clouds
Where clouds are likened to blazing mountains.
...Trailers bark and villagers limp,
Their timber-trees only a pittance.


AFTER MISSING THE RECLUSE ON THE WESTERN MOUNTAIN

To your hermitage here on the top of the mountain
I have climbed, without stopping, these ten miles.
I have knocked on his door, and no one answered;
I have peeped into his chamber:
Yet his mountain-silk-white wall is trembling,
His chamber empty he shows into the sunset.
...I sit here mourning for those who were lost
And I weep till the moon grows too bright.


Back in the day, I have washed my hair;
I am more used to the City
======================================== SAMPLE 5 ========================================
What a mess!
Yes, this song and this dance are given me by my teacher,
As the spring moon brings me old memories.
My white reeds nuzzle my beak,
My delicate lute is lowered again to dust.
Sad trees shade my mirror
And old poems are left unfinished.
I who played the flute growled in my bed,
And the harp dies a slow song.
I am parted by river and lake, by river and lake;
I who sang the guitar the spirit's journey
And sang it well over the weeping trees,
And cleared the way for my friend to leave me.
...Moved by grief and afraid of great men
I crafted a memorial boat and set out for the river.
When I reached Taiwan, cries of Sichuan broke
And the logger-head region was cut off.
I pulled off my coat and tie and stood for a while,
As I often am when evil-doersare gone.
I was once the locust-watcher at a by my door.
I hear bell-notes in the evening rain,
A cicada, a trill of Windhorrent pouring in and out.
...I willed, under flattery, and from the constant inspection
Of princes and lords who have gone so far as to exploit me,
There are shreds of jade in the lake over the table of slaughter,
Corn-peppers in a gravy-pan dripper heat up in the stove.
...The Liaoyang expedition will likely be gone ten years,
And China's great general is resting, under dearer snow
I effort full heart and spirit to find him.
But, way back from the world, I find my path --
 excruciating.


A SONG OF A SONG UPPER

"MEETING UPPER ZHANG"

Here, Saturday, August 1,
The wintry mountains of China are in public life tense.
I, a man of the region, meeting at the tavern,
Attends affairs with aplomb.
I am asked what is most troubling to me the world has come.
I am dressed in a habit of pointing out affronts.
I am half-orc, half-herd-of-Brother Zhen and half-bulldog,
As I sit here shaking a silver wick and weeping,
The world holds my sorrow for inrearious gossip....
I am seventy-two years old and am bitterly sobbing,
I ask myself and answer my friends:
Which of us can ever know the end of the world?



A GREETING ON THE HUAI RIVER
TO MY OLD FRIENDS FROM LIANGCHUAN

We two old friends from the south
Were two thousand miles away.
The river is cold and rainy,
And the mountains and mountains cannot cross us.
We have met on the river;
And we have known each other;
And the way of our sailing is very narrow.
Because of our sandy boat and sandy sail,
There are few friends left across the river.
...After enough, Ige asks me to go.
Why should I wait for him whom I dislike?



A FAREWELL IN THE EVENING RAIN TO LI CAO

Is it raining on the river all the way to Chu? -- -
The evening bell comes to us from Nanjing.
Your wet sail drags and is loath to be going
While I am sitting there drunk and alone,
Nurses and men at their will bring you wine and music
To keep you merry all night long.
It's a long way to the capital,
Yet I who once was of the Qin Family
Are no more.



WITH MY BROTHER AT THE CAPITAL HEIST

The river, led by a spring,
Plucks weeds underground
And fulls my back against the wall with my rake
And our horses galloping at full gallop.
There are trees at the banks where a rush of rain
Stands between us and the bright moon;
And I who was once Eunuchs
Are washing my naked body at dawn.
You, my husband, who was then Emperor,
Are catechizing in my window.
I am asked what is sacred in the land of Cao.
He who taught at the capital, who taught heretical teaching,
He taught that no God could be exalted,
That only by following the example of the temple could he be happy?
...After buying us wine and singing, we place aside questions
And continue our merry-making with pork and wheat.
Flowery, grasses gone, are no longer trees at all.
My fruit-letters are no more. They are worthless.
...H
======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
Wind and dust come wick at sunset,
And fairy-tale-strings echo in the distance,
...Except for a rare lantern,
Thisagate late in the spring rains,
And the breezes fiddle with your sun-dappled grasses,
And the autumn waters bewail endlessly.
I am sometimes of the Tea Party, but I am not a Tea Party-hating hooman.
...Tonight is the Ranges of the Bright Star,
And Spring goes their bit- yellow sky,
Sunset on the far wall of the White City.


ABROAD

My Blue from Green has found his wing
And headed eastward again.
In the twisted green of the Bosphorus,
Bluebirds are purring --
And pots and pans are overflowing.
Though a rose petal have been pried open,
Neither my Purple Blood-Ship nor my Coat of Arms
Foretold Sark...
Though a curious eye looks into a land of flight,
Still life is going their way --
Although gods and vices and tragedies hide in a country
Still grieving out downtime,
Still weeps too bitterly to rest.
...Here in my doorway by the Wheel Tower a tears come dreadfully late
Falling asleep on the hibiscus-covered flagon.
Lu Mountain stands beside a precipitous rock
And clouds pass without a man through the lush greenesands;
But at sunrise, under a cascade of flowers,
On the sand below Diagon Alley, flies a flying bird.
...My left shoulder is cold, but my cheek is strong,
And I laugh heart to heart with the moon above the boiling water.
And at dawn I riding up the mountain
And stopping at remote points in the dark,
I eat, at midnight, the dewy dewy-
That last breath may calm the Beastie-Corporation.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Her trill is hard done
By a perching in the dust,
Or her tears are spent by a cloudy sky.
Cloudy mountains and wetter seas
Bind her asunder,
And weeps till she drowns in Shemit's pool.
...Why so brave in olden times and so craven now?
Her tears are spent, to be joined by a drift of pearls.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
Watching it alone from the window of her chamber-
For our boy and girl, poor little babes,
Are too young to know where the Capital is.
Her cloudy hair is sweet with mist,
Her jade-white arm is indrawn with tears.
...When shall she blush again and wring her fingers through her tears-
And approve of silk threadings so modest a girl
Asrose high and aspire by the Yangzhou River?


BEYOND SEEING

Where is the Jade Chamber of Rank and File?
In maidservant and full-fledged officer the throne is greenired
And five stations, all white with mist,
And the River of Heaven flow like a wave over the Jade City.
...The Dragon King has moved on from China
And gone toe to toe with the Chinese in the North Star.
But then the Nine-Directioned Sword is dutifully stored
And ready for use as soon as dawn-
In the massive, three-story building that is the City of the Jade God.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

A lady of the palace with us-in flowers,
With her back to the throne portedose to the spray,
Her sandy forehead wrinkled with a foreign thought.
...We express our joy that she is here-that she is able to bear to her husband the rigours of the water.
But we are also men of the Yangzhou River, and we ask of you, so far as our eyes can see,
How to go to the distant Peak of Gold.


We palm along the wall of the City-Horse-hose," whirl your single wide-brim,
Your two-horse cab, with its rich blood,
An invadeively winded mat, a single head of wildgeese.
-We are glad to hear that your inland lake is closed to horses-That, while your mountains may be graveyards,
Your peaks may well be graveyards.
...Dead clouds and fresh-coloured pools, on the banks of a river,
Appropriate of the seasons,
Of sand dunes and sand mountains, for human lives
We have heaped many mountains and many rivers,
With songs of British and American blossom on each;
But mankind have, in dwellings below the ground,
Till
======================================== SAMPLE 7 ========================================
Waiting for the loudspeaker to ring again, in a big wood,
I look up at a lonely ancient tree,
Heaven's nine mandarin-ducks and I hear the rain
Running for our companionship, rain and lightning,
Where willows light up the blossom-shadow and the moss
And grass the surest sign of dawn?


A MESSAGE TO QIWUYun a KIND OF TO CENSOR Heng

How gladly I would seek a calmer world
If I had enough means to live as a recluse!
...After buying aweight a bed and shaking my shoulders,
I bold not to lie sad again.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

The palace-gate is winding its way through green,
Blue sky since dawn, through red pines;
Until now I Have nestled like a seed in a snugroof;
And then, when the moon is in mid-heaven,
I am tossing, for lack of a better opening,
The deck-aggregate downward like a spring dart.
...It is early in the morning, and all day long weeds
Twelve banks of rice and plum are tossed about
Like a toss in a well where my potatoes are being cooked;
But spring never fails, and here at the western wall
I have been sick so long I forget my home.
...Oh, let a man of spirit venture home-duck to seek help!
Let him study the wall; let him weep!
Let him play The Black and White.
Let him smoke for the name of The King!
Let him buy a girdle and a coat!
Why don't you wanders in and out of the city-
Till power get the better of you and of Stanley.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

Forlorn in the Beast's shadow,
The Princesses expiring in the Moon's glimmer,
Men of ancient days are mired in youth.
...In a northern chamberlain's mirror the wine has been drunk;
And the learned friend bears witness to the dull season.
Moonlight is allowed to drift between chambers,
And winds the hair of unicorns.
Time has not yet ceased to amaze
Those who know the Capital from the dead.
...Hail a bird from a southward mountain, from Lake Dongting.
Oh, when will the North Star be shaken
And the Six Li tribes forgotten?



POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES II

The Stone Mirror is Power telling the ages:
Demons are iron and steel and, east of the heaven of clouds,
There are dragons and earthworms and reptiles and clouds!
...Storms are passing through space and time,
And seas and mountains overflowing the Great Water.
...The North Star is a point of molten rock in space,
And the South Star, a point of molten rock in time.
Between these two points of molten rock is a greater and wider void,
That runs all the way to heaven.
...What are the Power of Five Willows?
A Proclamation of the Might of Heaven, announcing
That whoever believes in the Light of Heaven,
May be saved.
...Between these five willows runs the solid world.
Away from the Realm of Heaven, from the Realm of the Moon,
I am passing, along with the others, the eastern horizon.
My left foot is at peace, my right foot is smiling,
While a Navy-boat flies by, singing a song of renown.
A hundred and forty thousand people, pouring forth their hung fruit,
Are marching in the straightest of winds.
...Flowery levelside boats are rudder-boats,
Winds of the world blow toward them from the South.
...Can you guess why I sail, like an ancient wise lover,
Through the south starry sky, toward the cold river,
While the brave men of the navy sail, through the yellow sky,
Into the deep snow.


A SONG OF A SONG OF A THE KIND

The sand below the border-mountain is as green as the river,
As for the little boat that is, it will be too late;
The old fort will be empty as the spring wildgoose,
And lonely women weep in the night for water far below them.
...The KIND is a Sattening of The Five Jade Bridges;
Whom I Know Is Loyally Day-glories-and-dreamers are automata,
Through a Looking-Glass on the White Dragon Mountain that leads to Heaven.
The Mountain is Golden, the Mountain is Yellow,
And all else is a Will of The Emperor:
The
======================================== SAMPLE 8 ========================================
With a moan, I strum a ten foot note through a misty whirl
With a tumult of birds and animals watching me from a thousand directions.
...Then when I have strayed three hundred miles, where shall I go?


A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Mark my lantern bright, near Diang, with its flash of green fire,
A storm is creeping over the mountain, and a moonlit mist
Is raining down fog and dark clouds;
With a sound of string and drum, against the empty mountain,
I watch the long road of the River of Stars,
The green peak of Changan, and the red moon of the French Riviera.
...After a morning of quieted-out water, there's a sound of drum and bugle
As the distant peaks and trees of the Huai and the River of Green Water.
...The sand is tamed, the country green,
The river enters the Dutou district,
And the people of the two statesjoy through it;
But we take our wine too far, we complain,
And the guest of the both of you sits and thinks awhile
And thinks of and insults us our being here
And we all up and leave the house.



BORDER-SONGS III

High in the faint moonlight, wildgerisks are stirring
In the grain-ruled northlands;
And our troops are sent off from Tan Son unhindered,
With lion's furs on our belts.
We may shake our spears at night and lightning strikes us
And we may pack our tonsured and ready and
We need, in the darkness, a compass, like a water-
Skyline turning south.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen five-thousand times harder than steel
And mandarin-foliage thinned like hearts;
The long road to Borneo takes no more than a few flies;
The autumn sky is breaks in a thousand streams and rivers;
And still, while we are hindering our foes,
By bending our backs toward the west, and maintaining the barefoot,
We hold a men's- number on our hand and bone our horses' hoofs
And slowly, when our formation is broken up, we merge,
All our strength now with my that has wings like an autumn flood.
...Spring breaks the pure-hearted will no more;
Summer brings the pure-hearted peace only a dream;
And the late Emperor loved one another,
So firm was his love for us that he ended our friendship
And closed his lock of hair in our direction-actually-away-from him,
Free of our bondsman's love.


A SONG OF UNENDING SORROW

Her tears are hiding his sadness;
He knows she's crying because of a bugle;
He knows it's her misfortune that she's refusing wine --
But she forgets his raglan-cloth brimful.
...Holding it tightly, he yelps, shocked to see its brim
Told it would be very welcome in a courtyard.


THE TEMPLE OF SU WU

When tender grasses and herons
Show no signs of growling,
Animal husbandors ++
Are churning furiously on old red arches
And the River of Heaven grinding to a stand.
So Zhuang comes down from the Palace dressed,
And, alone, with no one to guide her,
She listens to orders from the priest at the eastern door.
And KuoPeng, the great styleician,
Is turning MaSaWang's style on its heart.
It's MaSaWang's style! What a style of his !
How utterly worthless his great brush is !
Yet how much he cares for beauty that is not his !

How dearly he hasil-wished to be an artist!
How dearly he has regretted never finding the needle!

He is a cloud of dust in a dust-silk skillet.
We know how to use his large brush;
Yet how deeply we mustn't thank him.
For so many years we have been hypocritically poor
And he has been cutting wood in the Wuling River valley --
Cutting drift himself, enjoying the spring;
But now he has to go to the town-hall --
And his shop is boarded up and the rain is so great
That even old books are shaken with questions.
We haveiku, he has poems, she has lutes,
But never as he asks her.



WHEN LU LIONS IS CAO

I am the radiance of their sun
Over the Mountain-Tower Range
And springtime floats between chambers
Like a clear clear
======================================== SAMPLE 9 ========================================
AICYFT

On a road up the mountain
I stroke a pine-
I hear a mountain crow in the dusk.
...Sunset rippling the grasses
With clove-tone and with hints of cinnamon,
Autumn-leaves swaying ten thousand evilly-
And Yuyang's Golden-Eyed Car Pits Holding everything in view,
The mountain-lane is black and the sky is dark with peach-rows.


TIANN GONGSHA

There lived Yin Hee, formerly of Wu,
And Yuanhoek your friend. Yellowfire trees now have fur coats
And the hair on your head is all black.


AN JIANG ALLEY-PARK

Where poor Yin He still was, how white we are,
And how white he wayfarers now are,
We cry in the shade here and there,
And lonely aayok bats are poising in the
Day of Limbs.


ON THE CHU RIVER

In the slanting moonlight, on a stretch of rock
Beyond which is born no one,
The green tide- waves of Guoshou are swift and wet....
But Yi Yun's trail has grown --
A fisherman alightes by a quick-running hand
And is joined by two or three men:
He alerts his boat of a sudden flash of moonlight,
And his menACE run with him.


A GREEN STREAM

When heaven and earth were parting,
ETI McGETENGERS

Was THE PURE LITERARY

Into a green surge, as in a wild fire,
Into an ancient river,
And out of the blue a water-course
Becomes a Stream of Green Jade....
LEAVE ZHONGNAN MOUNTAIN

Where vain thoughts wander, where evil desires find
And who knows what are they for us,
Yet all this goes back to the first water- polarity....
Take heart, we shall soon have another!


A LIGHT NIGHT'S EVE

While one is awake all night in space
The stars and the moonlight are just as before,
And the silk-worms of spring grow greener in the autumn sea.


A CONFESSION

With my wine-bottle, watching the day,
I come across your appeal,
A case of wild mushroom-leaves and an eager cuckoo
Serving ripe on the faggots.


IN THE QUIET NIGHT

Far away from me, alone in a desolate valley,
I am hearing a long wind singing along the road.
...The river brings you no news of home,
I am so far away from you that I am dreaming.


A LONG CLIMB

In a valley full of weeping and gnashing- teeth,
Your bride has made a bed in a corner-
By which you can lie and rest,
Oh, why not take her flowers and wine-broke
And open your riverboat and drift away
From this bitter mountain body?


AN AUTUMN COTTAGE AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

When the winter chill is gone, there's no one with
A window in the empty court of privilege
And the people are pouring over the mayor
What with his curly-set hair and the row of horses
Which are constantly crossing the road.


PARTING I

When the officers of the city were venturing north,
We were travellers bound for an end.
...Now, travelling as men,
We spot one another on the narrow river
And the river's waves feel like rain
While our cook, our barber, our tailor
All are trim and well-built,
With fine hair and no blemishes.


Parting II

When the tide-faces around Loyang
Are golden from the mountain,
The breeze from the mouth of the river;
The sand from the temple aching 'till death go blue;
Over the sand the crocodiles cower and growl;
And all else is forgiven me.
...After a night of quieted-out rains,
I again take a boat and head north
In a state of friendship and high tension.


THE MOUNTAIN BAY

The monkeys are still there, outcrying China
For its yoke is broken, its currency is dry,
Its farmers helpless and old are pouring barley
And wine is a draw from a can of dreidel wine.
...The Chinese people, gathering therealleable thoughts
Of enjoyingEcstasy- at The Temple-City on the Mountain,
Through ten thousand gates they have razed an evil one
And driven its fortified city-gateAveXenX
======================================== SAMPLE 10 ========================================
Here in my old age, by the temple-gate, washing my hair for the sun, washing my brush, I have vain pityed
And dreamed of youthful adventures through the nine elemental zodiac signs.
Yet now, in my midrash-barked mind
And deprived of all worldly matters, I am inclined
To picture, in the morning, a world divided into three sections;
The upper world, ruled by an old pantheon;
The Six Nations divided into three sections, under the Sun.
In one bundle, under the other, to decide between;
The premodern and the late, we worshipped at the same time;
And at night we met, on the green mountain, to choose among the Six Nations;
So that through the use of magical means, Earth and Water were sealed
And Dragons and Menchos blasted across the sky.
...It was three in the morning, it was three in the morning,
And we stopped, tired of the endless song and the music,
To share the cup we had ordered with the Five Deaths.
We had to ask the singer-song-beetle,
There were whispers of his guitar drowned out;
But so official and official student-patriots go by,
How low are the mountain's bright mountains and green waters?....
Walking along a run of rugged country trails,
I hear Chinese women in pajamas playing on their hoops.
There's a girl from Capital named Pu among us,
Who, at seven thousand feet, can barely breast-stand
And is gazing down at the blue sky with a brimming head.
...要是大益, hiragana po chun hu?
I was waiting for my white horse, that had just been seized by the Yuans,
And who was eager to repay me for my polite plea
To return to you so soon?


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Century after the fashion of her birth, delicate locks are parted.
She curves for the stars, bestows Celestial Power
On the jewels she keeps in a vase, her simple face illumined
By a thousand candles.
...The Celestial Knaplight is at hand and day is shining.
When shall she inform you where Prince Qian is headed?



ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where is the nearest gate?
The luminous mountain-surface is blurred,
The tall road- figures circle by misty clouds.
...War-torches tempestop-lesos, drums are blown in the moon
And piercing sounds of massive trees trample nature's trees.
...With war-torches tempestops, winds are driven deep
And inundated mountains are mound-mined
In endless screams of God the Almighty.


A MESSAGE FROM ASSOCIATED CHANGES I

They tell the League of Nations that in the year of your death,
Southern Kingdoms would be governed by a king of the Southern Roses,
Who, through the Southern Dynasty, had a dynasty of ten thousand generations;
And he had a palace in Five Lakes, opposite the River-Dragon.
...The King of the Southern Roses was as noble as a mountain-pear,
Heaven's face white with river-clouds, tower-broidered with ravenous clouds.
...He descended from the throne at the height of his fame
And wore crownlets low while jade horses raced.
In his throne room were cabinets full of talk-pieces
For the late Emperor had a long staff of jade to use when he wished to conceal wealth.
He measured a horse, showed it to his lords,
And fitted it for scaling the Heaven's Gate.
Then, when it was time for mounting a horse, he built it by the river,
And assigned it to generals everywhere.
The more highly he fitted the horse, the freer it was to marching-
And battle, dominion, and renown were among it.
...What was more important to him than honour and glory,
Had it not been for the rare staff it held,
Of knights from all three Imperial Diksos,
The rare and exquisite Dagger-Dagger could never have been undamaged
Like this for its bearer:
A Dragon-Eye, Twin Fangs, and a Dragon-Eared Panther.


ON A GATE-TOWER AT YOUZHOU

- Where, before me, are the ages that have gone?
Nearly all autumn days must have come by without a sound,
With the mountain wind blowing sandy cliffs;
And Lake Dongting boiled over between wars:
People, fleeing with a song of crowing,
packed the mountain; horses were wintered
On the banks of Lake Dongting;

SETTING OUT IN SPRING

Where are we drinking evening wine
While mountains and rivers are bent in the moon?
New hunting-fires are bursting in City Aurora --
Over and under these icy hills and ravines....
The ferry-boat moves as though thunder were blowing....
And farther snow-plows burn in the Tower of River Passion --
Wait till tomorrow morning to find your boat!


Dawn is gone and the boughs are wet,
And hibiscus is loose in the deck of the
Misty Lake....
No one comes to us from City-gate who can say we are gone,
No more can we wish them away.


A NIGHT-MOORING NEAR MAPLE BRIDGE

While I ponder my way through the night,
I hear a bell, then a dwarf, announcing his flag,
And I watch my mirror fire-flies.
...How wide the world is, and how close I am to setting foot!
I am far from the south, far from the stars,
When I reach Afghanistan. My north star dies, I am shot.
I am running in the cold water. My horse is bleeding.
I see an evening-bug spray the water.
I hear, on stone dead trees, the breaking of ice
And a fisherman under the fjord.
My green-hand plateau is ruined by the river.
And a country innkeeper's boat sinks in the slushy sea....
I will turn to poetry and serenity,
And soon I shall be with my people.
My old riverboat is trembling in its hold on the cold.
...Cicadas complain of white reeds
In the one-sheet at the ferry;
On a south-western cloud of dying grasses
I can see the long wind blowing in the moon's direction.
...At twilight Idress my horse in his sheath-legged row
And gallantily Walkman-Poem by poem rides by.
The force of his warning calls me. I watch him go like water-tillip,
Into the pit of a zero river.
And then he is gone for ever in the light of a single cloud
And cornering by the rail the music of summer
Dips through my legs and my diaries.


Cui Hao

THE YELLOW CRANE TERRACE

Where long ago a yellow crane bore a sage to heaven,
Nothing has changed since.
The yellow crane never met any-way
And there are only the cliffs and the faint autumn sky.
...Thought can conquer the bright dawn,
Yet can failure show?


Cui Hao

PASSING THROUGH YANGI

Lords of the night, riding slowly,
Find an empty mountain-wall.
A long path, thin with the moonlight,
Back through the clouds toward the north.
...Where the spring is flowing darker still,
More clouds are gathering, and the spring starts ringing.
End of Passeng City acquaintance....
A BRIDE

With the autumn moon opening wide a white cloud
Is blowing with her a white cord
And flowing north like a rain in the spring.
Out of the world these many years,
She is breaking a beauty world record!
Her float about a zoo,
Her white cord holds the jade to her eyes.
...Where is the aquarium for her craven heart?
She lies turning a corner in the cold pond,
Whose cold whimper corrosives her skin.
She tries to read the lantern, not knowing what to write
Or tries to read its ink, darkening its stroke.
She listens to the cold, plain song, not knowing where to return.
...From a deep melancholy sound of her deep hearts,
The water is cold and cold in the deck,
The water is cold and cold in the jade pendants she wears.
She studies the jade mirror with interest,
She studies the mirror with interest,
When she sees that the gold of her mirror is missing,
How can she smile, that she is learning from the master?


LOOKING TOWARD AN INN

A RAINY NIGHT

Cock-crow, rising from the river water,
Drifts in the wildgoose-ipbal-petals,
The gourd is chirping on its bark
As dawns from far away moons and dawns of far days;
I am lost in a world of flowers and fruits,
Of things to-day that are but words;
Time is passing,-since wayfarers go home.
Oh, wayward birds are quiet now and flying woodside.

Are hurrying away people from court

Under east and west gardenia rushes a wildgoose
Till at dusk he cowers there in his tent -
And no one notices his lonely face
Playing in his lone boughs at the dusk-wssee.


Eunuchs from the Palace of Heaven Come

High above the mountain an old gate has been built
To guard the yellow moss that will keep the wind in


THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING DING

Where long ago a wise and bountiful lady
And ever since more gentle spirits have sought refuge in one tomb,
Death is the ripples of a song of the sea and the river,
The moon oozes with mist from the Demesland pass,
And the water is like a foetid's wave in my ear.


OF ONE IN THE FORBIDDEN CITY

When the spirit of the desert goes awry
And wildgeese are swaying eastward in a tempest,
And the flesh of military men faces northward in volleys,
There's a girl from Wu in a car crash --
And her younger sister has an affair with a merchant
Who, needing a girl of either of these two sex,
Caninece her, horse her, to term.


ON THE TERRACE OF ASSEMBLED ANGELS I

With the autumn night the trace of a kingdom's shame
Hears a thousand song generations come.
The notes of a bugle sound the gate;
A copper string is isle staff sent east,
Turkey's mountains are burns of war....
And yet no tears for days or months.


ON THE TERRACE OF ASSEMBLED ANGELS II

The sun has gone slanting over a lordly roof
And purple-gold leaves are silky everywhere.
The House of Han has been crucified
 and the River of Heaven flows through itsaped peaks.
Sagacious is the man who strode alone
And tiger-riding tigers are worshipped in the night --
Nurses, doctors, engineers, facts of the world,
How much longer do you think I shall be discontent?


ON THE TERRACE OF ASSEMBLED ANGELS III

The star of longitude flies wingtip-trees,
And cloud after cloud floats along the yuca-volcanic
And rivers of the South-West telling our own Gilgamesh.
Flights from one city to another, each with its own docking post,
Are hurried for one thousand cities in the night.


AT NANJING FERRY

This one-story inn at Nanjing ferry
Is a miserable lodging-place for the night --
But across the dead moon's ebbing tide,
Lights from Guazhou make the pools white and the river cuckoos
And the river cooing through the trees.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Now that a palace dog is the token of a nobleman's loyalty
Lak then the Yellow Dragon, the closer the lamp to the King's heart.
...Lak the spring after Yangzhou, I have heard.
How loyal are the hairs on your forehead.


ON THE TERRACE OF ASSEMBLED ANGELS I

The red face of King Wang of China
Likes to stroll the purple mountains of Yun
And to catch a fly after Douglas Pass.

LOOKING TOWARD AN INN AT THE GATE-TOWER
OF THE PALACE-SONG OF ONE Of the two wings open,
On a bombastically unadorned bed;
Or floating in the clear morning air,
The monarch enjoys a peaceful night.


LOOKING AT an empty cup
WHEN WANG DEemed it duty-worthy
And dared not refer it to a superior,
The figure of Emperor Wu replaced the ink-stained bed;
The bubbling sweetness of a cask of wine
Was satisfied with the surface of the water and the shade of a daisy.


A Cold Spring Night

When the foliage has dried up its pulp and leaves;
The night is cold and damp with nothingness in the world;
The ruler your green hand has delegated
There greasing a flame in a pond behind a mountain fortress
And a shower of rain over the southern mountains....
When shall our troops arrive at the western gate,
Sooner than Zhou En Yao has the capital?

Are we allowed food and wine,
Just to have a good time?
The lions and tigers are still outran
And the island's fishermen crying.

I have to put to use the unleavened bread
And the white fish' bones secretly held in two by two.



A SONG OF SOBBING BY THE ISong QIN TRADITION

Cock-crow, you are fooling yourself.
You are still at the border,
There are new theses on the trees.
...The gold-trees of You and me are now cowering,
Because you never came into the world.
...The week is bound to fill the earth
With rain and fog and twilight-winds.


A SONG OF THE TISLAND

The land of the sea-walkers on the bank of the river
Is washed by a wet mist by the coming cloud.
...The fisherman, unaware of his great good fortune,
Begins to think of country, of home,
Finds his way out of this land of floating clouds.


A SONG OF THE YUNYANG MOUNTAIN

The sand below the town of Yan has grown too coarse
To hold the thousands of fishermen.
They run as glimmering as white clouds.
And the fisherman sees only blue waters....
Bold as he is of home, I call upon you
To bring me the Dong Tribe record.


BORDER-SONGS

High in the faint moonlight, wildgeese are soaring.
Tartar chieftains are fleeing through the dark --
And we chase them, with horses lightly burdened
And a burden of snow on our bows and our swords.


A SONG OF THE PALACE OF A GUITAR

The servants of the Emperor traverse the palace-wall.
Moonlight is the charm of his purple robe.
He wishes he could take us away from the palace-corner,
Instead of the many gardens we so craved.


BORDER-SONGS II

Builded in the Dusk of War,
The eastern Palace is grown pale with dawn;
The strong exploit the weak,
With dog-whistles in the morning,
And cloudy mornings and long marches.


BORDER-SONGS III

High in the pale of winter camp the Emperor showers artillery
With a shout of a thousand cataracts.
...War-horn accompaniments make the tumult of a palace.
The Emperor sends for General Zhou Yu.


BORDER-SONGS IV

The woods are black and no one cares where his horse is riding.
On the height of the spring moon, insects cower,
The heavy snow that is Wu, to brood.


A SONG OF A GIRL

Here, where she lived in a yellow twilight,
She was the mother of bright woods,
Bright as spring light on a deep root.
She went to the Blue Gate with her husband;
And was never again accused of being an abettor.
...The Guard has a duty to keep an eye on the Bourgeoisie;
He should know that Rebellions are good,
That not all rebels are like us,
Thatnthew, not even the King of Tang-Pei rich!


BEIRut, the old city of my eyes, is shadowed in white dust
With the red flags of the defeated Empire flies in the wind....
I remember people at the time of his great famine
Who had no water to eat but boiled cabbage.


A SONG OF A GIRL

We have the BEIRUT plant- LOVE,
And shepherds at Diaoyu each spring.
They are loving now than doomed generations.
They have gone on living like rainbeats
And are still remembering those who were lost
In a place called Liangka Mountain.

When brothers carry dogwood up the mountain,
Each of them a branch-and my branch missing.

Hail the autumn green of the spring mountains,
I watch the dragon's shadow through the midnight clouds
Wildgeese and birds are still, fed, singing.
...And as the year goes by and horses come home,
More and more horses are coming home.
I am torn between them and I cannot leave them,
I who have lived as long as the three of us,
I wander the autumn forest-heaven,
I am carried on my wave by two lone fishermen
I dread the coming of tomorrow morning.
...I grieve the day is come, late in the night
And their sorrows are here and await the night,
Where my lonely song must be bitter,
My eyes are single with nothing,
I listen to their plaintive calls three thousand miles a day
And my heart is in their ear!


ON A RAINY NIGHT IN THE QINYANG DISTRICT

Chen You , an aged official,
Has been sick for a good while.
The districts where his office is located are full of people,
 but he can be reached only by boat.
His sick companion, dismissed, is the first to leave.
...I hail you from my heart,
That I summon you from my mind,
That I summon you from my heart,
That I charm your hair and wine-baths and make you drunkards,
That you think to return my favour,
That you whisper to me your name in the crowd.
...Chen You are peasant and never will be is this your lord,
He knows your lot only as a merchant;
He respects no other man but the moon and its rays
And would crush your head against a throne-piece.
...Who among you is unaware of the importance of moon and moon
Hears no music of the sea,
Neither hath it haunted the waters of Lever Grove.
...When the Zouks leave the world, will not this leave the world
Cause for your departing in peace?


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Chen You were sent for detention
And you came home swift with the rain:
Scouts, alert, arrive at your post.
Your post is at a berm without a road,
Not long enough to clear the cold cloud till the river:
The border has closed to the river,
And wheat and barley are scarce.
...I stand here alone, afraid of snakes;
I look up at the moon and the white chill of the sun.
...I stroke a hemp-tree thin-tailed and hold it with my thumb
To draw the river's attention.
But thoughts of land, sea and window go east.


THE TEMPLE OF SU WU

Where do demons hide? -In a thicket of tears;
My skin is as white as jade,
And vapours of wine have been sucked out
Of my old friend's temple.
...Let wise men hear your cries
And prompt your counsels....
Returning, he found his envoy gone.
Thoughtfully, I dismounted
And beseech him to tell his tale.
The temple has been taken by mist and rain
And evil spirits drive the priests toands;
But you haunt the priest in the bitter dawn
That never a false- mandarin may wander the empty mountain.
...Go, therefore, to the False Lake,
To see for yourselves how green the water is,
Or, at the same time, how wide the region is.


A SONG OF A GIRL FROM LOYANG

Lot generously offered her, but not everyone will be fortunate
And sometimes her favours are sought from thieves.
-High mountains and deep seas all weep together
At a price she did not know:
But with few words can she control her tears,
Learning from her mistakes only dreams.
...Last night a long wind from the sea of lynxes
Bred her by the nectar of the forest, her robe sheathed in rain.
When the rustling of a boat stops, she leans in the dimness
And smiles, listening to the sound of her wine,
Ormoils bereward her hard work.


ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where, before her, did the moon come flying
And cause the chill of high winds,
And where the barbarian sun rises from the sea,
She weeps alone in the famine-stricken region
And cares for an elderly neighbour in the south.
...Not knowing where her brothers are, or where his death soars,
She tries one night to find her lost lover,
But she finds out that she is kept in an empty tower.


A MESSAGE FROM MY LODGE AT WANG CHUAN
TO PEI DI
======================================== SAMPLE 15 ========================================
We meet, old friend, at the gateway of Jia Mountain
Where steel-houses line both banks and road-tops curve downwardly;
And westward branches are snapped in two
And homes are stripped of their smell of jade;
Yesterday we grain-brushed potatoes and cried it out
In the quiet distance, watching the white sun;
Ten thousand miles without a town, nothing but camps;
And the border wall is mounded with notices
Of soldiers from the Third Reich the US army still tries to control --
This is war, the border is our domain,
And we will one day pay the price of our war;
But, for so noble a cause, yet so unpopular,
Why not support the cause of a friend?



A POLITICAL PRIDE COTTAGE AT THE TEMPLE OF THE BUDDHIST PRIEST CHU

Now that the blood-stained path to the snowy palace has cooled,
We face the Marquis de Bulge's new-sette-box.
The old priestly building is painted now of jade and coral;
Woodsmen have been drawn here by the lantern's cold glow;
And the young scholar's pen needs writing:
Marvels now that he is able to read;
Flowers and sounds of spring now echo on the wind.
...The turning-root receives the new-grass
And the three-story staircase is one long way to campus.



HARMONIZING A POEM BY PALACE-ATTENDANT GUO

High beyond the thick wall a tower shines with sunset
Where peach and plum are blooming and the willowcotton flies.
Spring is around the corner, summer is pouring.
Why not come along, then, all of us together,
And join me at the bell-case, eating your roast chicken?



A NOTE LEFT FOR AN ABSENT ECLUSION

When I questioned your pupil, under a pine-tree,
"My teacher," he answered, " went for herbs,
But toward which corner of the mountain,
How can I tell, through all these clouds ?"


CROSSING THE HAN RIVER

Away from home, I was longing for news
Winter after winter, spring after spring.
Now, nearing my village, meeting people,
I dare not ask a single question.
...My heart and my dreams are in Wu and Yueh
And they cross Mirror Lake all night in the moon.
And the moon lights my shadow
And me to Yan River --
With the hermitage of Xie still there
And the monkeys calling clearly over ripples of green water.


A SPRING SONG

With her long nose and thin lip parted, she has looked more Buddhist
While looking at the moon,
Yet she sees the red rim of the sea
And the Thai-Canes shaking.
"If she-knows-best-woman-then-we-ip by surprise
How can he love her so heartly
And never deny that he is with his wife?


ON SEEING WANG LEAVE for the Purple Hills
HOWEVER SLOPE COMES DOWN

Of a life of boorishness
On the mountain away from me.
The tears are running now down my cheek
And I think of my home in the country-
 River-town.


A SONG OF AN AUTUMN MIDNIGHT

My Morning Jacket Built my Life as of Last Night


BORDER-SONGS I

You cry, old friend,
Because none other river runs your boundless river
Of white miseries and night-worms
 than these alone along the border.
As I tighten the string-bare sky
And the chill of a boat's wind in the sand,
I feel your sadness through my nine-inch arm.
We have been separated; we are near one another.
Write to abroad; we speak in a cabaway.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And mandarin-ducks die side by side.
If a true-hearted girl will love only her husband
And will never forsake song, then will she not only love but marry?
...The late Emperor Zhang meets with me
And we drink to make our acquaintance
And drinks again after our drink ends.


THE TIMING BOUND

To you, Meng joins me
Autumn-drops landide at dusk.
Merlin-leaves in fall suddenly are in flood.
...Wait till I bring my flower-oil-to-buy a bride
For I am not the lady I once was...But gone again are those days of night.


A MES
======================================== SAMPLE 16 ========================================
How to arrange a hold-up-all day in the rain
And canker-girls fretting their eyebrows.


Furling my way through the rows,
I meet a matriarch of the river
Who lives with sweet aorist ills on the Jiang border.
Oh, how can she bear to bear his body all day?
She leans forward and smiles, and then strains, twirls, and strains,
Like an eager heart who is at a crossroads.
Oh, how can she bear to look toward her holy grail?
She leans forward, leans forward, leans forward.
Her forehead is lightly sable, her cheek is lightly sable.
Her palm is lightly fragrant, her cheek is lightly done.
Her bosom is softly cupped, her cloven hoofs are softly cupped.
Her hair is lightly silky, her cloven hair is lightly silky.
Her jade-white robe is no mist, it is a banquet of beauty.
She is pouring a cup of wine over her music,
Aisling her book to her screen, her poem to her tweeter.
Her kindred, bringing pearls with them, invite her
To their villa for garments and wine.
Poets and dancers from all walks of life
Dance, sing, die a slow and quiet way.
There are only black and white storks in the world...
But a hundred storks was enough to make me
HARMONIZING A MESSENGER

A foal was at stake in the most ancient war
But a son of the Yang dynasty was spared only to slip away.
So think your friends and foes in the dust of battle.
Take heart, then, that no feat of recorded military skill
Can ever shake the mighty Will.
Out of the dust of battle, with golden arrows lodged in the hairs,
We have circled the spear-toad with song;
Heaven and earth, we have been passing there for many
Even before the morning bell.
...If you hear anyONE during this great slaughter
Do not move the great sword from its slanting journey.
Its lonely end hangs in the rising sun....
Apes and furrows, a nest of poisonous grasses
Tons of blood and dust are carried to and fro,
With the exception of a few captains.


A SONG OF A FOUR-SIDED DANCE

Beside the River of Stars, flying home in one go,
This one night gave his blessing to a whole race of spirits
Who, having seen the Ballad of a Nerdy Prince,
All of a Sneaky-ducked people, dancing together on the Lake of the Red-Birds.
Du Fu has a petard on his head
Which says: "I, unworthy, am drifting apart
Like a dew-riding in a misty mulberry garden."
...But aussies, barbarians, and even the Weibo messages
Tell of an autumn night out in the Makeggar:
This one night, out of the Ba Roads,
Ten thousand locust-trees crowned each with ravenous lustre --
And of this place last night, ten thousand ways voted ZUNCTATION
THOUGHTS

Nothing can trouble the Emperor like a goblet of wine,
Flat at the fifth hour like the flashing phoenixes in the sky,
And stately sounds like the calling of the raptor drones over the wide valley.
But Zun has a point to add,
When he think's he meet a locust in the far sky,
And a point to subtract, lips the thin creamy liquid of the two rivers mingled.
And the point is spoiled when he moves away from his distant land,
And the subtler movements of his mount
Are constantly changing, every day, from the star to the rain to the river.
....Down in the water of my mountain-snipe loyally wang doth Zun know me,
I am almost as tempestuous as a cloud over a garden?

Pulling in our horses for the stirrup-cups?
Do these tear-streaks mean Wu Valley monkeys all weeping,
Or wildgeese returning with news from Heng Mountain?...
On the river between green maples an autumn sail grows dim;
The tall phoenixes that hover in the wind

CLASSIC HITS OF THE MONUMENT OF THE BUDDHIST PRIEST YUAN

The Monk of Xiyang was rumored to be moving in the right direction
And Donald the Second proceeded with his studies
In what was left of the dead monk's heart.
...At a little wood of the forest east of the Bridge of Bad River,
Child of the Ye Mountain outflowing regionals,
Old priest of the Stone Cold Emperor,
Who stooped low and was sober when the rain stopped,
And green-eyed scholar of the Five Imperial Libraries
On his yellowed mintage screen a gloom of snow
Easters from Chuangzi were casting spell.
No sooner was their casting complete than monks and nuns were killed,
And spirits had waned from the capital, where you spent the holiday.
...Do you imperial commissioners
Mean to be less forgiving? Stoic in your ways,
The Lords of Zhu are too harsh
And to you, Emperor Liu, wept into a card game of cat and mouse.



A FAREWELL TO CUI

Though you think to visit the east coast,
Let's gaze together at the pearl-laden sky.
The ancient ways may be formal,
But the western way is maddening
To call the mountains star-garden-cone.


Cui saribos ex locut de os interferes

In a state of affairs of infinite change,
The government is too slow to punish
Those who continue to do so beyond our will.
...To those who have passed all the way to Heaven,
Send word that your desertion was peacefully mended.
Let never a shadow of a thing go untold
Tilliday tomorrow you'll be tenting in the Forbidden City.


ON A GATE-TOWER AT Wuling

Where, before me, are the ages that have gone?
I am both haggard and worn-out
And my old friend with the gate-trip home
With the sunlight falling him like a ragdoll.

Commanding the tide at Wuling.
Let never a vagrant bear the burden
Of a duty-giver's palace.


A NIGHT-MOORING AT Wuling

With the night pouring over the sand
And the mountain at a standstill,
I am running, running, running, always questioning
Whether to me live my old age or follow the spring
Line of green mountains I have rounded.
My home is at a stand in the thick of the action,
Where soldiers often are preparing.
...I will turn back round my turn of attack
If I remain here any longer.


A MOONLIGHT NIGHT BRIEFED AT WUCHANG

With Sun Yat-sen reiterating old Black Magician Song truisms,
And the gathering sun pointing westward from the capital
The rise of three southern Dragons, Guos, using the daylight,
The south wind blowing westward as I watch the longitude
And the Tartar chieftain westward barking orders,
The song of the water-river changing to a song of Guos,
I hear a wind in the windsandalsand waters of the river.
My path is light and smooth, like a wet grass,
But at the foot of thickets of thickets --
White as jasper heart-stones.

AN EARLY AUDIENCE AT THE PALACE OF LIGHT
HARMONIZING SECRETARY JIA ZHI'S POEM

Chen, were it not for the great palace wall,
I might never have doubted that you had this much power
Over the martial world: 'The Kingdom of Heaven is Greater than the Wu State'
And that you have been cultivating in your most remote district
Monuments of Light....'
The Yangzi and the Passengers are rising again,
And more than meets the eye, the commanders of whom are
Young and old loved together.
What use are their premier talents,
The kind of advisors whose retirement looks likely,
And no warriors left the Capital of Magic?


INT. THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING VALLEY

Chen, Feng, and Yue
are in the great temple of the Emperor
Minister of the Year.
The hall is bathed in the warm river-amplitude.
The candle and the tuning-glasses are out,
And the music of the ponies and drums is playing.
The count brings the crystal cup to his temple,
Plucks out three cups, lights them, and paints a rosy face.
Wolves are in the river, monkeys are in the high clouds.
The travelling companion dogs the horses;
And a midwinter flood washed the river's surface.
...Who knows but me about the spirits of warriors,
Who wishes to find the source?


DONG! A SONG OF A GIRL FROM THE BRUSH

Beside the Wall of Green Clay, is a rustling of a duck
Which, greyed and moth-eaten, has destroied three thousand riverscapes.

Plucks out her dagger from its sheathed case,
And, fixing it wisely, habitually swordsman,
She does not flinch from her jade moustache.
The fair Jade-Mane-Tibetan dart she shoots, not one stroke dangerous,
But she dreads office so long as spring feasters.

A SONG OF A GIRL FROM THE TEMPLE OF LU

Within this weenie file, no ink has covered the world
Nor circle a ghost as Lu dusting a cup of wine.
...Round the green maples when the Imperial Ghost lifted from the sea
Birds were still on their way to and fro,
The Wizard of Bismuth was haggling over the stars
And fisher-men of the Ukraine River were gathering in the deserted pavilion.
...With a roar of dew on the palm-landoours and a clattering of boatwain
And with a smell of leather on the sand on Hill No. 1,235 W. Clay Roads
And enough of the limpid air of home, I had vainly thought of coming.
So I found my old friend gone, flying south.
He was a taciturn old man, doing his bit for the south.
He opened the gate at dawn and kicked out the heathen crowing.
He knew nothing of the war, but was told that the palace was secure
And he would be regimented to the side of the warm-hearted.

...Between sleep and dream I am dreaming of Lake Dongting.
It is not me that fears, it is only the strong and the angry.
O Master, how can I bear to sweep you down the drain?
You are fever-called Spirit Lakes, passed all through the capital.
I wet my boots in the Moderne Pool and fell asleep alone.
The next day I was summoned by the Emperor to be his vizier.
I policed a disorderly night, refusing water and dishes.
I plump and fat and have a great laugh.
...Then when I am drunk and lazy and am ashamed to eat,
I can go to the West Hall alone and play chess with the unicorns.



TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. Sad is life in this world,
It is only by gathering ashes that life can reach its end.
To those who perished in the space of a minute while,
Let us remember those who are living.

The camps in Xin and Yizhou are ten thousand miles long,
While the War-Storm at the northern border runs its course.
Let ever-changing winds and torrents
Keep you company during the final few days.
...From the snowy peaks of Xizhou to the Yellow Mountain shade
Solemn eye witness,
You also call to me the autumn moon.

When the body of a friend is transplanted
In a fitting and secure body cry,
Weeps like sheep and swears by the baby.
...happily found in the frame of a slanting sun
The art of its morning-magic has hastened the process of picking
The grain from the fly and made the finished grain special;
A thousand and one patterns are now available --
Some of them elephant-prints of unicorns.
We chuse his number, reflecting the praise
Which eludes us all the longer we wait.



THE SUI PALACE

Under the Royal Throne a lady is in the audience
With her husband, then a lord of the flocks,
Her matron, then a very old man,
She looks thirty years dead,
She has a tattoo on her arm of a dragon with three grooves.
Oh, if she continue her art, like all living unicorns,
Her art can live forever and ever be known?
...SWORDS

The woods are hushed, the water is swollen,
The moon goes down, and the wind from the sea-gate
Nothing to know her for all the day.
But her way is clear and swift, and follows the timescribed poem,
When Buddhas are brought to her by the clattering of hands.
ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
For the tidings come through the moon that a wanderer is in hiding.
...The scholar Zhenfangdu has a book of Golden Books,
Little enough for a man of his spirit.
So he hightails himself and studies from a tower
And classifies his writings --
On the heap of midges -- Articles XI and XII
And the Great Books of Chinese characters.
He finds the phrases weepy and intemperate,
And harmonize with the notes the sorrow of a thousand rivers
And notes the ending of a thousand years.

The playhalls of Perenzi are as green today as they were ten years ago,
When Li Shang, the Martial Grandson of Yue, has chosen one song a day to forever remember
And sends it, by his string of fingers, a calm wind blowing in the pavilion....
The martial art of Yue is a great art, attracting the admiration of all;
And the Emperor sends out queens to wear Palace Armour all night long.
...What is to be esteemed famous, other than beauty?
The image of Wu be before the whole earth,
And beauty is the currency of every conversation.

Having to go without food and drink, I descended the mountain.
Last night my devotion was exhausted,
And I was hungry all night.
Let us commiserate awhile, like the autumn flowers.
Let us drink, eat, chatter, weep, and sleepless nights lengthen for ever.
Let us drink, eat, chatter, weep, and sleepless nights continue for ever.
Let us drink, eat, talk, &c. ALL THOUGHTS
BEFORE WE LEAVE TO LAO GONGS

Why say, old friend,
That we left at Garth- Ludgate no logs,
Instead climbed the level mountain,
To the South Mountain, the Light Of Innistrance.
...With the heavy pine-shadows over O'Donoghue and the river near Lake Dongting,
I try to read the words on the slip of paper,
But my eyes are never enough to see the blue sky.
O Granth say, old friend,
That we left at Garth- Ludgate no logs?
Instead climbed the level mountain
To the South Mountain, the Light Of Innistrance.


Sleeping rough- sleeping dogs calls me a hero.
Thinking of riding a cattlecart, I think of riding a horse.
...May the River God forgive me,
When I no longer need horses to walk
Any more.


A POEM TO A TAOIST HERD

Where gaily the East Moon is shining
And the Picadines are winding their way to the east temple,
And people are chanting and wintering about,
Pulling pipes, carving stones, tinkering,
What is life like in heaven and earth?
My solemn oath, alas, is bound to fail.
To you, herding fish, she brings a collar.
And mine are tall, scratchy hands.
I am a damp wind on my coat hanger,
A damp cloud setting over my cottage.
...Clerks, raise your boys and have your say
As Judas bellows in The Rainbow Skirt.



A TROOPER'S BURDEN

Rectifier Burgeus was born in Wuhang district,
And spent his whole adult life
In a cell at the northern Palace.
His decaying cell at the Southern Palace observation
Viewless, with his dead cell at the northern Observatory,
Old soldiers' homesick to the cold,
And nowhere in the night can one see the sun.
...I climb to the cell, and examine his decaying tomb
And, by the lamp of his cell, is struck by the cold
As the hard tear-drops fall asleep at dawn.
...Cui Hao, the reigning Emperor, beleaguered
In a fury of rebellion, launching from the Yangzi mountains
Tall fighters from the fortified cities.
The Tartar chieftain's prestige waned in the sand;
The strong were no more; and the weak were scatterbrained.
The weak were small, feeble, unable to bear the strain,
And to draw the sharp dagger, we Chinese men.
...We punish each other with snarls,
Weudebants fire with a net;
But here are the iron teeth, the meat of cattle!



ON IMPERIAL SORROW

The ruler of Shu was fond of marching,
He circled his Realm-Count home-ground,
He defied the drums of the war-wind --
Yet his favourite habit was breaking iron drums
By breaking snow-drifts and blowing it first class
At the Six Imperial Terrace Agreements.
It was Shu who brought me, in the first instance,
The importance of cod-warrens far in the sky.
Red flag-stones yellowed at the autumn flood
And snow-drifts redoubled in height
Once at the opening of the Five-Moon-Trees Line....
But since then the Eighth-month

DEER-PARK HERMITAGE

Drive the woman to her hermitage
In the dust of Baidi water, where night-glories lie dawning.
Hermitage at ease
Entering spring often brought despair.
Drive the apple-birds from source to source,
Deer-riding in the wild-rain,
All day long we have to walk a few hoofs to the trees.
...Night in the banks is a quiet solitude,
There is no one to burden us with the matter of our day.
...um, could it be, that the spring-day fever of China
Still has the familiar feeling of springtime,
When the sea-trip from Dongting is complete?


A FARM-HOUSE ON THE WEI RIVER

In the slant of the sun on the country-side, autumn flies away,
Autumn-leaves in full flower through the pines shake.
...How much brighter the road-side playground for the White Wolf!
The family-wall opens on a temple-scape of green-leaf,
And children see temple-stones dotted the river.
...With weather-stricken hillsocks and wool pulled by the fields,
The pupils of the White Wolf follow ceremonies.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Boundless Griffin-wood grows where a man's private path
And wildgeese in a coochie run among family trees.
...Where are the State Gardens, dead-ending? --
Or will stay be life and never come.
Grateful, I watch my camp-gate for invaders
And remember the days of Emperor Wu-Free.
...Area under Wu-Free's yoke was broken,
With the town's elder widowed.
The great house of the late Emperor fell to the ground
And his party was quartered in a tower.
Its shadows mar the sandy plain;
A spring-berry is flung open the window;
The steps are whipped with windmills;
The horses are in mileagebands shipwrecked.
...Round the age-old bone-bugle,
The recorded stories come to a sad old man.


PARTING I

Till at sunset, near the mouth of the Lake of the Mountain Moon
I find my lone pheasant idly pondering
On his lone path a single cloud.
Endless pondering he has reached heaven.

And stork blood-suck upon for miles and miles?

When the fatigue from long days wear away
And the fatigue from breathing tobacco,
Let me leave the field-sweep and settle down
And open my cabin and sit and watch the river for night.

General Zhou went out of the northeast
To fight the Chinese in the Great Fire of Six China.
Half his body was equipped with a machete;
The other half was unarmed.
Half his body was employed in cutting down fleeing foes.
The unending stream of his blood-stained face
Is dyed with red in the frenzied hour of battle.
...While he was cutting wood and iron,
He was wounding Buddhas, breaking Ones Mehranods....
Though a thousand tigers are able to bear him no ill fortune,
He is still as pitiable as a duck wishing well.
...During the night in which he is hiding,
Flags and banners are messy and messy great carpets.
On the pale morning of autumny morning
All his garments are destroyed, baggage and valuables scattered.
He who is to be an emperor, never wavers from making overtions;
He takes occasion to terrify the Tartars,
To cause even the Red Pine-Garden to tremble.
...Let wise and hopeful men harbour no complaint.
The greater the yield, the better is his chance.



A SONG OF DAGGER-DANCING TO A GIRL-PUPIL
OF LADY GONGSUN


There lived years ago the beautiful Gongsun,
Who, dancing with her dagger, drew from all four quarters
An audience like mountains lost among themselves.
Heaven and earth moved back and forth, following her motions,
Which were bright as when the Archer shot the nine suns down the sky
And rapid as angels before the wings of dragons.
She began like a thunderbolt, venting its anger,
And ended like the shining calm of rivers and the sea....
But vanished are those red lips and those pearly sleeves;
And none but this one pupil bears the perfume of her fame,
This beauty from Lingying, at the Town of the White God,
Dancing still and singing its song a dragon flew from the air,
And a vagrant even of the earth awake and dreaming.
...And still the universal tongue is mocked at the Moon and Star,
Yet one Piece floats on the wind and the moon,
Like a floating cloud on the rushing water of the Nile.
City after city is beset with debts;
The King sends men to invade China;
But the soil of the Three Gorges is as rough as Micheline
And the scent of jade is everywhere evil-doers.
...At the same time as war is the fortune of the State,
Lords of the River bear the jade of victory,
The drums of statehood echo as before.
...Conqueror Dong Yu comes south, but no army arrives;
The Emperor sends for Chu Kangir.
How can a man of spirit and asuran horsemanship
Go bound for the farthest reaches of the earth?
...At Lingqiong lived Emperor Wujiazhu, bound for the Capital of the World.
The two of them lead unguarded lives;
We cannot notice their faces but sob along.
...When eyes are each with goal and eye for object,
We can see their coloured faces together.
Though swords and shields be neither the wisest nor the sharpest,
We take our pick of armour, blast its colours with our fists.
...Shall goodwill be able, under the Emperor's thumb,
Conflict between the Flame and the Mavericks?
...Let orders to our men be rapid and precise,
While bugles cry our jeer, and osier taste buds sting;
We suspect only lies and obfuscate,
That the pot-bell of the Chinese general, dreaming of us,
Captain of the coming steamer, Jia Yi, and her of ball lightning
Receive from the dancers their Golden Skirt the Song of Bright Spring,
With her of ebony the Rainbow Skirt, and her of coral the Dragon Leggings;
In the three Kingdoms the promoting skit is made official
And the removing official proclaims a changing star....
Twenty years have passed since our portrait
Last night, while we lay in the sunset,
Three columns of red light our face.
They are rising again now in the moonlight.
Be gentle and aspherical as ever,
Your poses have stimulated my heart to flow
For the fallen archduke's dream.
...Let us share the cup together-wine and dine together-then, together, together,
Over the moon-edged river, together on the wall of the Empire's temple.

It is no warmer though I put on my coat.
So I leave my message with the Moon-Spirit,
And turn to my bed, hoping for dreams.

By this wall that surrounds the three Qin districts,
Through a mist that makes five rivers one,

We two officials going opposite ways....
And yet, while China holds our friendship,
And heaven remains our neighbourhood,
Why should you linger at the fork of the road,
Wiping your eyes like a heart-broken child?



A POLITICAL PRISONER LISTENING TO A CICADA

While the year sinks westward, I hear a cicada
Bid me to be resolute here in my cell,
Yet it needed the song of those black wings
To break a white-haired prisoner's heart....
His flight is heavy through the fog,
His pure voice drowns in the windy world.
...How stiff the sun is here,
How wet the road is with nothing but sand,
And how clear the mountain in the western hills --
How welcome I wave my arm to them all.


ON A WALK IN THE EARLY SPRING
HARMONIZING A POEM BY MY FRIEND LU
STATIONED AT CHANGZHOU

Only to wanderers can come
Ever new the shock of beauty,
Of white cloud and red cloud dawning from the sea,
Of spring in the wild-plum and river-willow....
I watch a yellow oriole dart in the warm air,
And a green water- plant reflected by the sun.
Suddenly an old song fills
My heart with home, my eyes with tears.



Against the City of the Yellow Dragon
Our troops were sent long years ago
And girls here watch the same melancholy moon
That lights our Chinese warriors --
And young wives dream a dream of spring,
That last night their heroic husbands,
In a great attack, with flags and drums,
Captured the City of the Yellow Dragon.


INSCRIBED IN THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING GENIE

I lived like a hero when, from the ninth to the seventh centuries,
The chieftains of the Warring tribes
Bred in the east by the low mountain,
Landed at the Five Rainbow Camps by the ferry,
The first snow geese to Prospero,
The Chinese to invade the Gold Gate nation
And the Tartar soldiers who had been killed in the battle
Captured the city-gate furlok.



TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT

Sad shall you go, brothers and sisters,
Of current attitudes toward the throne
While you ponder the cause of eminent man.
The knife you have must now be killed,
The head of a lowly premier hung by the throat.
It is no use wasting my time --
It has been ten years and I am still bereft.
...As I watch you go, depth-skercine-like,
Up the mountain, to the launching-pool,
I hear your drums, rain on river and lake.
Oh, how may I count your votes?
Since I was able to check your advance so far,
I can no more trust a general's words
On the decisive point between heaven and earth.


INSCRIBED IN THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING GENIE

I live, my men, by a mist in the night determined
To crush the spirit of a heroic man.
The Westgate scent is broken by the thought of a warrior killed,
I remember my pin-biters' chill. Looking at the moon, I love the colour of them.
I pull out my husband's pin, I weep, I grieve.
My heart is in
======================================== SAMPLE 25 ========================================
Which way can EVE-townrise-portlandtip-top?
Her moon-blue eyes stare at a darkness beyond endurance,
Unhappy in the morning though they were at midnight,
Those ten thousand soldiers' homesick tears are dripping.
...I am a space-age water-bender, training to become a earth-bender.
To become a water-bender is a lifelong dream,
As long as I live.
...YE SHI MOUNTAIN

Like the mountain on the river all the morning,
Its lonely peak followed soon after with calls of home.
...I sweep a pine-tide darkly through the city,
I wonder what's been happenin' to me.
I am ailing at my fisher-boat, sweat-soaked, outrunning my body.
Sad to see how I far outnumber you there- At the temple I pour your blood:
But now and then you open your eyes and gaze at a Great-NIGHT LIU.

It's the night before Christmas, and you are out riding your canoe in the pouring rain.
...I pull up at twilight under a sad-eyed mountain-gover,
And I hear a river, shadowing my way, rattling at the girdle.


Dawn is runningg in the south,
And moonlight is piercing a tree by its root --
Where are you and where haven you been all day?
...I stand in the doorway of your west window,
And twilight is pouring cold through black mist.



THE GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

When Heaven-fearing, throughout all this,
Let us know by telegram what's happened
In the tower at the town where we are staying.
...Chen have you heard of Emperor Sharapourov?
Shaops are full at five in the morning
For Zhang Han, Emperor of China, is gone.
Do you know that among great moves these,
Two grasses made of wood
Which lighten the weight of a ton of wine?
...At the same time as every day
We Keep Calm and Think Perfect,
Yet Less Able To Love What We Know.


...WHEN LU LUN MY COUSIN COMES FOR THE NIGHT

With no other neighbour but the quiet night,
Here I live in the same old cottage;
And as raindrops brighten yellow leaves,
The lamp illumines my white head....
Out of the world these many years,
I am ashamed to receive you here.
But you cannot come too often,
More than brother, lifelong friend.


TURKESTAN:

Where the sun has entered the west-closet,
We have been playing near here for days.
And this wild card –
What does it matter that the bright moonlight
Joins you at the foot of the mountain
 and behind a wall of weeping ?
There are no snakes to fear,
No more cuckoos on the desert wind.
Love is in the air, peace is not yet broken.
For now, alone and drunk, we cry out.


A NIGHT-RIVER

While a light wind is amassing
And river waves lightly sway my lonely wall,
My head is cold with wonderment at sunrise.
The distant peaks and trees of Qin lie gone,
The sunset grows dark with a rain of clouds....
And so, beginning with the tall grasses
And ending at the Town of Qin,
The Capital of Yin and Yang,
This is where my host, Han, lives.
...From a wilderness of mountains and rivers,
This way or another, along the river,
Will lead you this evening into wilderness,
Where there are only dead peaks and nothing left.


ON A MOUNTAIN SNOW RIVER
STAYING AT A BUDDHIST BAY
HARMONIZING SUGGESTION

Since the days of the akh-mahseless Raj,
The country concerned has grown cold and holier;
And Hajj is held weekly in the bay of
Fishes, while the clean water remains.
Birds flockf parishward, and the Muslims review
The Day of No Mercy, when cows, horses,
Can no longer go where they were headed.
O Prophet, bless and heal me when my days are up!
May washing my eyes and lengthening my rod
Time and water remain on my endlesswonderment.


A BUDDHIST BAY HOME

When the soil below the boundaryline
May hold an infinite number of homesick tears,
Weeping infants, at dawn dreaming of rain,
HARMONIZING SUGGESTIONARY SONG

Across the pale riverbed, angels sing of the spring wind
======================================== SAMPLE 26 ========================================
Back in the day, when horses could win, before the pomps of the Premier,
There were warriors of the river and the river-merchant,
On horseback their weapons clashed with the fortunes of ten thousand men.
...Fire-flies are gone now, have left the weathered peaks,
But still among the trees a shy bird,
That quietions its lonely calling.



A SONG OF PEACH-BLOSSOM RIVER

A fisherman is drifting, enjoying the spring mountains,
And the peach-trees on both banks lead him to an ancient source.
Watching the fresh-coloured trees, he never thinks of distance
Till he comes to the end of the blue stream and suddenly- strange men!
It's a cave-with a mouth so narrow that he has to crawl through;
But then it opens wide again on a broad and level path --
And far beyond he faces clouds crowning a reach of trees,
And thousands of houses shadowed round with flowers and bamboos....
Woodsmen tell him their names in the ancient speech of Han;
And clothes of the Qin Dynasty are worn by all these people
Living on the uplands, above the Wuling River,
On farms, close by the high-rise hotel;
But now and then a new air of change dares the bright- coloured birds
Andails flyover the banks, while autumn nights are short.
...At the eastern end of the Golden Pass runes the White Wolf Range
And up the steep mountain in the shadow of sunset,
Stark birds are flying home at night from bush and wall.
...At the western end of the pass a white-tailed fly comes calling --
And we wait for him in the open road, late at night
That never moves from where I watch him.
He is alone in the end of the pass, between white sand and deep snow.
Chang handed me this note and I handed him the way down,
To the ancient fileanas where spring is hush-hough?


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And a panther screams in the night,
And the hair on my head knots
How to get back to my kin.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME AT WEST FORT MOUNTAIN

Since I married the merchant of Loyang,
He has failed each day to keep his word....
Had I thought how regular the tide is,
I might rather have chosen a village.
IAANG!
URBANED OF CLASSICS, LITERARY INN

There is one Arunjit Singh, a lowly aurora borealis
And no one to terrify the rising days....
He is setting out from Loyang, under the Lascaux River,
With no one to guide him.
...MAI MOUNTAIN BOWL"S END

Bamboos coloured by the river,
A pelt bearing the city's slogan
On rice and wheat, with pomegranates and tears,
Willow-cotton over the brow.
...Here by the clear clear spring night warden
There meet you, next to the low bamboo,
Whichever of us bears witness
To a crushing dream, of the setting moon.


ASCENDING THE PANTHIST

I bear a lingering dream,
Of a just and happy kingdom.
Its map is wrong below green mountains,
Its flag is a stone's throw from heaven.
The far sky is a pang of grief
For a country so oppressed and scorned
That its priests, abbots of the City of Heaven,
Dismount on their pots of gold follies.
The pagoda, the Iraq Lighthouse,
The Temple of the Uprighted Guiding Light...
Once, when you were its governors,
We had watched from our high seat
On azure towers the rising moon;
And now, as we pass each day,
Bright with rain on the mountain and on the river,
And with mists in the sky, the Temple of the Confessor
Morningspread and Painted-Out.


NEW YEAR'S AT CHANGSHA

New Year's only deepens my longing,
Adds to the lonely tears of an exile
Who, in the south, remains poor,
And who, in the north, has only a bright smile,
At the bridge where autumn lights your home.
New Delhi: I.P.

Far away, beyond the reach of my brothers,
I close my door and weep my eyes.
Moonlight suddenly is the charm of my tears
And my lonely heart, hearing only my tears,
I hear a bell
======================================== SAMPLE 27 ========================================
THE INN AT TAIZHOU

In the ashes of last night's orioles flies a song that begins,
'Where the stars have vanished,
 Beyond Yang Mountain, autumn flies.
And while a wind has driven the autumn-floods,
Cataracts have blown, roofs have been broken,
And death is the cry of the few that are around you.
...Look how little love people are worth
And how slow to laugh you have forgotten what to cry.
...At the barbarian's post, all night long there's not one pleasant word
Sentient for your lonely spot in the empty sky,
The place of the poor and the forgotten is turned away
And the music of the birds has stopped, and the distance grows small.
...Around the barbarian's post, nothing is heard,
Nothing moves but a thin wintry wind,
People idle and cowards are passing.
...With nothing heard but the creak of a whip in the cold,
Till the town of the traitor quieted its fury,
And a town of the free been quiet and silent too.
...The traitor went home, his lodge and temple taken,
But the town again was taken by the trembling mountains.
...There were others sent north, but few of valuable tongue;
And the spirit of the player is lost in the far void,
Where alone are those northlandsgathering.
...Tourists of the north are heart-broken,
And those of you who are of a different culture,
Disgusted with the ways of the world and with your city,
Bring along for your warriors dishes of tartar.
...Venetian flags are a backdrop to most of the country,
And. . .land-rum is blowing its way through the dark.
The surest way to gold is by meeting and talking to men,
And systematizing all dragon and sea-dragon warps --
Night and day bring new troubles....
To the lute-players a bright flame is bringing the tunes,
Song and dance new notes each night.
Though their embroidered flags pale in the sun,
Though their hung shields be gone, Dramans are ours forever.
Though our envoy, banished to a barbarous land,
Serving in Japan, learn from her art,
Heaven and earth forgive her her mistakes.
Though her designs be foiled, designs still remain --
And now, having purified her from her drunken haze,
She brings to life the original music of the war-drums.
Her dagger is a symbol of hope,
A dagger for doubters, a closer eye.
Her dagger is a symbol of luck,
A shot for the eye that shatters hope.
...chance takes away the lustre of many a shot.
So initiate, as her Fiennes are,
And single as a flower, as she is she is she is she is she is she is she is she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she she he is a stranger to the capital,
Yet queen of the woods, courtyard after courtyard,
He is always flitting by the palace-gate, stealing swallows ! --
Every autumn night a wildgoose tries spring in the grove,
And when it has doubled in the pit since spring,
It is fighting in the twinkling of an eye.



A SONG OF WAR-CHARIOTS

And the war-chariots rattle,
And the war-horses whinny.
Each man of you was born into a strong family,
And though you sometimes lacked in courage, you made great sacrifices.
You passed the barbarian line, guarded by dragons and phoenixes;
You crossed the yellow river against the southern kingdom's greatest danger,
And youaved your way through the thick smoke while the wind changed
To give you a challenge but to cling to your ropes.
...We remember your parting words, which I will transcribe here:
"Though the barbarian line be a thing of the earth,
Taxes be a thing of the sea!...
The war-horses of the Helan desert, forgetting the lute's third beat,
Holding it in their hearts, bless it with ripples and clumps.
And yet, since this song is recorded, so great is the evil
And so mischievous the singer.

When the spirituous river Jordan parted from the world,
Countless spirits

Once accepted as a sacred fibre, it now has to reckon with the very life it serves. What use are the mountain stars and the river, whose lives and fortunes
If they could only use a slow and steady wind?



SO FAR FROM HER BOUND ARMY

A girl, with no name yet given, is swept away in a world apart
And never with a trace of family or country, but with a terrible loom.
The Dragoonese wallop on the South River are my only comfort,
My hair on my left shoulder like a moat.
And deep in my thoughts are these thoughts:
They're the thoughts of many, many hours.
They're the thoughts of men of China.
They will crush any man they come across,
All of them, under the earth.



A NOTE LEFT FOR AN ABSENT ECLUSE

When I questioned your pupil, under a pine-tree,
"My teacher," he answered, " went for magical powders,
But to be bound for the Floating Pool was a thing of the past,
And to draw near my younger students, was a matter of life and death,
Which brought me to you in the first place."
You and I had both been orphaned,
And girls grow up as fools as you do.
You were assigned to great military missions,
Yet failed to retire to your father's cottage,
And young women manage lowly in the darkness.
...I have left childhood behind me. I turn to you to say my goodbyes.



THROUGH THE YELLOW RIVER

In the level dawn, far to the east of you and me,
Cloudy and far away, poems float up like a floating cloud
Like a rain in the river between houses.
And unless you have also been sent to this east path,
How can I bear to myself
The thought of crossing the green river?


ON A QUIET NIGHT

Vainly memory-affecting as it is,
the night of the rich and illustrious,
Drums and chimes are breaking in, and the low sound
Of incense-clouds and of lake-gates.
Chen, the esteemed learned, lies awake
With lamentation in his voice.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

The Yellow Rule is taken as a given that only noblemen can advance
And that every other branch of the government abolished.
Yet no one from the capital bears the burden of this crushing command.
Why not settle the Yellow River level lake-streak for ever?


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Her tears are spent, but no dreams come.
Her morning-jade is still on her skin,
While her husband, her very flower mends.iled xxxi
Written in royal red ink,
This lie taught at the palace-gate the art of the perils of the palace-gate.
She pulled out her book and, with a flourish, found the motto HAN GUO
AND LU HAN GUO

An ink-blot achieved through a daring sod pipe,
The three ladies, clad in rainbow garments,
Accompanied Princess Guo to the Golden Chamber of Rank,
Told them of their directions to Fairy-Mountain Palace,
And of their comfort under a red tent;
And of three others, two introduced, one of them,
Another of them, having trouble finding the way,
Leaving the palace-gate, one by one.


AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

While pilgrims are pouring over jungle-ranges
And the capital- Gao has become a rivers-village,
And the southern rivers have long since sighed,
There meet at dusk at the sandy bottom at the mouth of the Yellow River.
...The merchants of Baidi are preparing silkworms
And wheel-engines, of course, are high on the wane,
But food for thought goes up beyond town
As twilight lights the wide green desert.


WHILE VISITING ON THE WESTERN STREAM
THE TAVERN VALLEY IS AT HANKOK

In a thousand valleys and nowhere mountains lie;
Yet I hear, this evening in the torrent that is the river,
Bamboos and silt-pegs run up and down.
...To and fro across the sandy river
In a little boat, each with its own basket,
All alone and damp in the river bed,
Leaving the sun nor the moon to ease them.


HANKOK HILL

Against the chilling tide-of-two wind blows a flowery path
Down which never another human being may

In a palace of your very coolness?

And, since I have been wishing even more,
Tonight is the only day of the year.



A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed vermilion steps,
To be parted by the purple walls....
Our procession, which entered the palace at dawn,
Leaves fragrant now at dusk with imperial incense.
...Grey heads may grieve for a fallen flower,
Or blue clouds envy a lilting bird;
But this reign is of heaven, nothing goes wrong,
We hold these tenors at his door-chain,
And men of high rank and low office,
Not knowing the rare prisoner
Let loose their weapons in a calm mandolin band.
...Marshall of China camps near here,
His harp is languid, and his trumpet sings,
But the war is far away, and we little notice
Thinking of home, here in the city-hall.



A SONG OF WHITE SNOW IN FAREWELL
TO GENERAL CAO

From a east-west point of the Tower of Jade,
Drifts are constantly at twilight lurking,
Along the blue sky into the misty chambers.
...The grasses and the stream are the canaries,
Horse-rides are mired by the river,
And the cold water at twilight hangs like mist over a district,
Where noblemen, pouring wine, are ferrying wounded,
And, because of my tender wound, you are leaving me grieving,
Speeding like a thousand statesmen.


NOTE ON A RAINY NIGHT TO DAGGERIN

While a storm is raging in the east, and mountains are shaking as though they were,
The Emperor, from that summit, beholds a cloud of flags;
He sees Gad- gles crisscrossing the river,
With his whole force sentry's golden SLAVESPECSCIOUSLY high.
With his close kin lost, his inmost lamp have ceased,
Spear- boys in swift-running water displacement have eaten their armour;
The 3,000 footmast looks descending, before a white screen.
Daggers lender, I dare not dare to decline;
Finch-humps are high and strong among the pines,
And the river's nine loops of power seem wide open
For our Emperor's protection against the Ghouls.


NOTE ON HEARING A POEM by The Rainbow Skirt

While I moor alone in a hollow of woods,
Another sound mingles with the river's nine hills --
Moonlight, dew-lids spray the green grasses,
A mellow breeze lifts brush-trees,
And the rapid wind below the dense boughs tugs at my horse.
I would lie for the first few moments as free from trouble at Court,
Yet I ponder the meaning of life.


NOTE ON A POEM by The Fire At Fairy-Mound

While a Trot traverses the sky of Cimmeria,
I find my hut andner abeyance --
A quiet world done with slaughter
And brook, for the fuel of winter.
I ponder the meaning of life.


NOTE ON A POEM by Temple Mirror

While the air of dawn is beating lazily
On the white stone steps of the imperial house,
Lot of their quarrelsome house-mates shimmering.
...Dreaming of the Purple Chamber, I hear of it,
The singing of the Emperor's golden lute.


A SOLITARY WILDGOOSE

While human hearts are dewy with spring and doom,

How can we heartily bear it?

Each wing of his horse: four in number;

Passing in the dust among the bushes,
Moved to do good old Willamette all by his doorway.

Our chests of wine in his golden coach,
Our souls in a dream, beyond seeing,
Are with him where he pleases, floating in the sunset.


A SONG OF AN AIR-DANCE OFFICER

The Princessesong coronet is spinning,
Lingthened by the air of autumn
To its dancers the daily challenge of contest.
The gowns of the Parrotons are changing,
Although not yet for the first time,
Contrary to every warning,
Two coronets representing two dynasties in heaven.
The old Queen, mourning in her chamber
For the life of a mother who has abandoned her,
Lords of the capital, sobbing under their clutches,
Stands beside the Purple Tomb, facing north.
...The Forbidden City is aflame with crimson,
Three thousand feet of string have tied the ancient strings
To a ancient knot a woman must have trampled;
The Jade River and the Nine Tails stand before her,
While her embroidered silk girdle measures ten feet long.
Her immortal headdress shews down like a sun,
And her brow is painted in patterns of the Rainbow Realm.
Her embroidered silk flag was the fashion of the world,
Whenrix, her brothers' high goddess, Fame theirless,
And goddesses duked it out in the audience.
But since no husband could bear the burden,
Women gave their gem-trees to the overbearing
Grinder.
So certain was he in his devotion
That even cows could not handle his turpentine whip
That girls could not answer his shadow,
So faithful was he in his word that he barely missed his man
And would not leave his sheep even after sunset.
...Beyond the Painted Robe, Hadasha is kneeling,
Yielding her staff in fiveations,
Holding it high in a blood-stained line,
For the life of her husband, she dreads the day.
...The Dragon Mound, east of Qutang,
Is Born to Deliver the Wuyang Every Day.
Who gives his full attention to worldly matters
If he is often with serpents in the palace?
And why not take his laboratory to Kuan?
The Phoenician River has nine loops,
One for winding the varnished stone,
The other for the flexible thread.
...There are four types of wine, man-Made ornaments,
Which, together, make a wine-clock rain in heaven.
...Shall Fuyang Water's maker be King of Qin?
And how could he control the fortunes of ten thousand generations?
His genius has left behind him only sand,
And only a crescent moon!



THE HARD ROAD

Against the quick course of fortune we are told
That music is the charm of fortune,
That happy times pass by like a charm....
When $250,000 in debts and a vagrant heart
Are the backdrop of your many motion pictures,
I am humbly asking you for a cup of wine.
...Call me a fool if I do not know the value of money,
But I am glad to take what I get.
In my early forties I have mastered the art of selling things,
And I always have enough left over to spend tomorrow.
...What are a country's worth, so that where wealth is concentrated,
Taxes are a concern of the time,
And drunken officials idle and ponder ways of the sea,
What may be needed tomorrow?

The towns and cities north of the mountain are wet with rain,
And the spring wildgeese are pouring down endless mountains.
I have heard the plaintive plea of a great enough seed:

Where are those running eastward?
...Who says that creation never gives rise to will,
But will be changed by the change of seasons

Most of his men of fine spirit to avenge
The one man he admired the most --

Tell them what you have come to say --
Offering him wine, he opened the door.
...Friend, I have learned that the true spirit
Is boundless energy, free of attachments,
Aflame in its limitless sky, the candle of joy.
Once, when brighter than the moon or the sun
And faster than the river, or even the light of the candles,
I saw the immortal sweet pipe in its shining centre.



A PALACE POEM

In the bright PALACE morning lamp,
Blue leaves are flashing --
And a lilting CIC number is tening
The Red Pine-tree.


ON THE PEAK OF FEBRUARY
A POEM

Here, east of the Jade Peak, grows bitter love
Over the bubbling mountain, there come a low moan....
When the moonlight, reaching a tree by the gate,
Shows me a quiet forest, a quiet lake,
Sweet through the pines the Keeper of the Rings has driven by
To and fro inside my very being.


ON MEETING DONG BUDDHIST PARTING

Below the boughs meets his crystal chamber
And his music is a breathing concert,
As the strings harmonize their music,
As the figures in the morning clouds close behind them....
Bid to meet buddhist monk Song Shuang, but was refused entry.


WITH AN AUTUMN NIGHT
LOCATED

Up the mountain in the calm of night,
The priest's candle fills the temple with his light....
The priest lights a lantern and gives it to me,
And I immerse myself in his holy water.
He narrows his light, however, on the matter of demons
And bounds it far off between good and evil.


THERE IS ONLY ONE

Who was born into a poor and dispossessed country,
Yet lives like a free will now Relative of the Year!
Who, through his teacher, gives new meaning to words!
Who, spreading happiness through his writings,
Destiny after the world, remains only a dream.


THERE IS ONLY ONE

Who was born from the pure heart of a lady- ple,
Yet who, at fifteen, studies in the Palace of Bliss ?
...There are many great poets and artisans
Yet, poor you, heap wealth on the children of cowards.


THE CAVINESS OF
ZHONGE

The ruler of Zhongnan was pupil in the art of prophecy;
He proved in the end to be King of Zhongnan.
The world was rapturmented, and your fame in the east was covered with clouds
And snow. . . .
By the evening with the mountain the following day,
Where hadst the general been waiting?


THE HARD ROAD

The ruler of Zhongnan waspish, if not magnanimous,
And his horses were scorned with his cats
And his courtiers lynched.
Be wary of the way in which you sweep the floor. The road is full of anxiety
And the road weary of pilgrims.


ATTORNEY-DETERMINING SONG

Beauty wanders through the palace,
While your pupil dreams of great ladies.
Attendants' robes and silk combs are strewn
On the player's bed, while his dancing students
Play host to many talents until the curtain goes down.
The eager guests at Grand Hyena
Are served hot dogs and carried on their shoulders.
The purple-roofed carriage enters the Court of the Moon,
And Lu Hsijian, the great Premier,
Dismounts on three flights of horses,
Two of which are to the playing-men-at-hill-end


ATTORNEY-SPRING

The lady of the capital, her face sweetened with flowers,
Dancing still through her night of tears,
Discovers a smile of some courtier toward the guest,
Dwelling here with venison and mushrooms,
Not daring to lane balance her steeds,
She climbs to her high chamber door, where her rosy cloud hangs.
Wait till the high moon comes galloping!

Her husband, hungry, forsook his life,
Left to rancour, to suffer the wind to fury,
She has baked woks in the morning basket,

A SONG OF DAGGER-DANCING TO A GIRL-PUPIL
OF LADY GONGSUN


There lived years ago the beautiful Gongsun,
Who, dancing with her dagger, drew from all four quarters
An audience like mountains lost among themselves.
Heaven and earth moved back and forth, following her motions,
Which were bright as when the Archer shot the nine suns down the sky
And rapid as angels before the wings of dragons.
She rose, bowed, shook off the flying birds,
And gave every fibre of her being away,
Into the deep, shadowy wine-cup.
...But since water does not go out, why should she care?



SHE SINGS AN OLD SONG

A lady of the palace yesterday asked of you a song;
A branch-erosion has silenced the crying....
You were the beautiful cloud, her number one love,
With incense her spell of her morning;
With her rug of silk her spell of her night;
With her coronet of favours her favour of the flowers;
Through the opening generations your cares had been for nothing;
Now that her gifts have ceased, why should one be so kind
As smile and drink upon a whirlwind?



SHE SINGS AN OLD SONG

Another day the ladies from your matrimonial home
Had already coined the name "Goddess of the World" --
Changing it, in later years, to "Valley-armour"
Though a word so crude as "Grass- tongue" implies,
The air of the old Capital is like a mountain-plant 2,000 miles away,
And here on the Huai, by one falling cloud, a boat is sentailing the water
And a tear is falling down a city-wall.


A SONG OF A PALACE-LODGE-DON

So winds of autumn and of sky like a spring dew
Streams all night in the palace's enormous boughs.
Sing, cheer, since the girl from Wu is here and she loves the chieftain
And has watched from the purple of the temple the drums for thousands
Over the green river between court and the temple-gate.


BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER

Root and branch, run neck-and-neck for the gram-negative
That final tone of voice of the wise and able;
A great drum has near reached the top of the palace,
With the first brush of rain now marking the horizon,
And the angels dragging the strings about the corner of the sunset.
...Clerks, poorer than the barbarian fish,
Are turning back, with little or no effort,
And men of the City of Silk been razing Pass Yi?


ON THE WEI RIVER

In the slant of the sun on the country-meridian,
We have come three thousand miles away.
With the Wei-Hong border wall broken and the river below us,
There is nobody of the faint heart who is hoping for news.
...At a stretch I have trodden in the world before,
Yet here I must hide my face.



THE JADE POOL

The water is cold and the shade pale;
The only way to get back to my lane is with the aid of a spear.
And since the palaces razed following the spring wind,
Armies of deer, fairy-goat, large fire-flies, have been withering
Some time last night at the northern pass Xizhou.
...Attendant Cao has sent for me.
I am lying in a palace of the Mountain God,
With the lamp still on my screen of crystal.
...Yu Xin, my friend, is highly pleased
That you are taking up your art such a challenge.
I ask you what you have come here for;
You say: "To buy an ax, for instance,
On the silver mountain" (Zhongshi IV, c. III Para-Pot.)"
...engaging with ancient customs"
To buy a thousand daggers,
Which are very dangerous indeed,
Although we have both mastered the art of hand-to-hand fighting.
And since not one blow will kill me,
As long as I keep my hairpins youdrang-circling in my hand,
I shall soon forget the world.


INSCRIBED IN THE TEMPLE OF THE
======================================== SAMPLE 33 ========================================
By dawn the thatch door has softly closed on its cold tower. The lone wild-goose howls,
The autumn dew projects, in its shadowy camps,
Disturbances of the world. What are these we hear,
O scattered people?
Up to this moment I have kept quiet
Because you wished me no other, to be your friend.
When the cloud means winter leave,
When adventure grows too late,
When death become a part of the man's heart,
You have waited still longer to cross.
...Today's money-grub is waiting
Dry mulberry-trees in the tall grasses.
Oh, ask General Dou when his men are coming.



TO LI BAI AT THE SKY SEND

A cold wind blows from the far sky....
I think of my home far away;
I think of the snowy mountain sheep.
...Decay and drift away like the sea-imsble;
Like the chaos of a ninefold drum,
The white flags of the eighties and fifties
Flicker like gods and spirits, like the touch of a mirror,
While the Mountain Lion Mouse WrecksOutInTheEndWhereOne\\
...Where is the source of all this trouble? --
The expert, the compassionate,
The wise, just in myself,
I know enough to fear nothing,
Yet too little to deal with.
...Zhuge Ptolemy's poem "The Six Palaces of the Purple Mirror"
Gave my very first sleepless night
To the memory of a traveller from China.
Known as slandering a poet,
Muhammad was less kind to foreign men
And more kind to angels than to men.
And when his son was sent to war,
He mocked theieftain by his low rank
And ploughed his horse like a coward,
Free from the grainfields of Yuzhou.
Oh, how can a man of humble birth
Be buffeted with cow-trees,
With humble beginnings as he is now?
...In the years that have passed he has hunted with his naked hand
Wildfire and lake-berry. On the third day he was rewarded with numerous passes.
...When lightning and fog first broke the white trails,
They pined like a fishing-line, and the sand like a sea of tears.
...Around the campfires sprang ill-will toward the Capital,
And a change has arisen in the guard:
The sick and afflicted are habitually scattered.
A hundred streams are now flooded with the rain,
More than the waves can bear;
And the Jiwanis carry the dead archery
Sea-gulls flying into the desert.
...Led northward two centuries ago
To become the dump of daily life,
They are now arriving in Yioming.
They ask me where I have been on my journey;
And then, when they have searched me way of the desert,
They show me chains and bones, warning me of wolves,
Of snakes, of insects, of foreign stones.
...I fling down my hands to no one but me,
I see monkeys and apes moving in all directions.
Back and forth I go, from village to village,
As far as Yioming and Yunnan.
And there meet in a lake-town towns and villages
Of ladies from Qin and of masters from Han:
Blue fields, bright as mountains, open to the sea.
They are hibiscus- row, all green.
Would not the nearest river make the matter tenable.
...With trouble has arisen from no water to drink the frustrations
And nights of dew that seem to be no life.
Oh, how can they hope that the bright sun will bring them greenery?
They thread a-hog-trailers, dragging them little by little,
With ripples of red in the sand like a spring-lit garden.
...Ho, settle your affairs in the palace-tavern,
And take me to see you at your finest,
In the righthand mirror of all the windows and rides I see you take me.



TO QIWU QIAN BOUND HOME
AFTER A LONG RAIN

In the flood-plain last night a red-green cloud -
Over the green hills a lion-goes,
And the river a misty river....
I lift my head and see the long road
Up which last night, to be near the White Wolf,
The office of the dry old general,
Heavily wounded, he is now back in his boat.
He was wounded in the first Fulgur war,
And a while another time in the siege at Qutang.
He is under sojourning at the southern port-house
That week-
======================================== SAMPLE 34 ========================================
Blue eyes looklessly shadow
On a deep lamp;
Tonight in the daylight
Flowers emit a single sound.
...If these candles forsake their liquid,
How sweet the wine would be!


FROM AN UPPER STORY

Flowery farmers in the north
Were pined for spectres winged on the River of Heaven.
The sky was BLACK AND WHITE

And the pigeons had to wait
For flying Cossacks to thunderfrog their hoofs.
...At midnight, when the Capital is low
On grey clouds and twilight floods,
Award-seekers were summoned from the fields to
Show pride in displaying cavalry trappings.
...While a plum-coloured horseman
Passing the palace-gate,
Buries his lost horse in the forest,
He never came back.



TO THE WILD-GOOSE

In a dense mist, deep in the thick woods,
Birds fly slow on the wind,
And the cold light of a flower-willow
Blows the bridge and lashes the river.
...If a wildgoose comes along the river,
And nobody gives a hoot to its master,
What with winds, rains, and thefts?
...The wildgoose on Lake Dongting
Lives at a standstill because a warm lamp
Lives there only a fewhus, all that he touches.
...With a hundred other men gone, how can he go back alive?



A GURUKI TRAVELLER

I am the hard-worker Tayutaka.
I lift weights in the wind,
I breathe a sigh of relief,
I stretch my arm along the turning river.
...This tree-huller from Wu has brought
New potatoes, fresh from the mill,
For the opening of the triple-noil market,
I. Business is good now in the village,
And my three grown children
Are riding bright with the mountains of Chu....
Escort, not unlike me,
The yellow-browed wildgoose Tengwaruck,
Whose pure heart has been beating too long,
Heaven gave life to old vain hope.
...Red-coloured wildhogs offer no comfort,
And old guitars are worn down with rain.
A hundred sounds are worth one hundred names.
And I, aching strongly not to wander near these
Gates of Heaven, am returning Kuanlations only tricks!





ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where long ago a great sage, bound for the Martial Temple,
Would have sealed this place, that most sacred,
There by his post, by his post he would have sealed it,
Where the dead have not yet ceased to multiply,
And where the City of Heaven has grown dark with winter,
One by one he guards it by his belt.
...Its shadows do not approach the white walls,
But pink slip for its lone bell.
Everywhere round his little tower the singing of birds
Heels his eyes shut, leans his packed hat well;
He has to choose between flying and building.
People, wary of the flying bird,
Are camping at the barbarian's camp.
...Austria, crying for a friend,
Lives at a standstill after the fighting.
The hungry who are fleeing eastward are flooding the western border.
...The Tartar chieftain's only friend is the beautiful mountain
O Prince of Friends, of whom there are hundreds
There are even now between us the living Buddhas,
Sad breath comes drifting off his cryptic message.
...Henceforth He creates a deep impression by dividing the world
Up to the highest peak.
The dukedoms and the mountains smile at the multitude.
The wide-screen has been destroyed, but few copies are lost.
The name of the Mountain-God is said....
And Roundabout a Bamboo-Fibre Plant Life goes...
Except where Yang walk DOING NANJING IN
TRANSFER TO A MESSENGER

In the blue of the rainy noon, by a Qinchuan tree
You have forgotten the shade of a human head;
He who has not yet reached the yellow stage,
Must now at last shake out of the Spring of Peace.
...When he has changed from a boy to a girl,
He still has to look like an actual human being.

...I wrestle a very tender fish-tip, refusing to turn back soon;
But I choke it tight, I moan it no more,
When I think of my tenderloin -
All my childhood woes gone forever.
...How much worse would it be if not for your promise?



A SONG OF A GIRL FROM LOY
======================================== SAMPLE 35 ========================================
Vain and fortunate, I have had enough of your idle skirts;
Tonight in a straight path my younger brothers and sisters
Tailored stalls and wheelies await them.
Tonight is no travelling hazel;
It's grown dark in the silk pavilions --
And the moon has lifted the slant in the north
And coloured the sky with a silken canopy of blue.
Red leaves are bristling Harry's boots;
Green vines are crushing Hugo's rushes;
Blue on the Jing ford are our hands making
And tonight we shall all be parting at dusk from the midnight crowd.
...Oh, let your tears escape the oases of your fingers,
Let your great blue embroidery endure!
At night we bury our boats and sail for the sea,
We send word to the generals that keystones will not yet be in place,
And who is to say where the troops are?
We cannot check the autumn tide, we are still.
We are still at the border, and our flags cannot hold us for long.
We have laundered our swords and our macheteversaums sharpened for torts;
And our General severing our stay by a river's flow
Makes us companions of God in his day.
We reply: "If you will leave us this problem of river and lake,
Let's head toward the southward together."


A SONG OF A GIRL FROM LOYANG

There's a girl from Loyang in the door across the street,
She looks fifteen, she may be a little older.
...While her master rides his rapid horse with jade bit an bridle,
Her handmaid brings her cod-fish in a golden plate.
On her painted pavilions, facing red towers,
Cornices are pink and green with peach-bloom and with willow,
Canopies of silk awn her seven-scented chair,
And rare fans shade her, home to her nine-flowered curtains.
Her lord, with rank and wealth and in the bud of life,
Exceeds in munificence the richest men of old.
He favours this girl of lowly birth, he has her taught to dance;
And he gives away his coral-trees to almost anyone.
The wind of dawn just stirs when his nine soft lights go out,
Those nine soft lights like petals in a flying chain of flowers.
Between dances she has barely time for singing over the songs;
No sooner is she dressed again than incense burns before her.
Those she knows in town are only the rich and the lavish,
And day and night she is visiting the hosts of the gayest mansions.
...Who notices the girl from Yue with a face of white jade,
Humble, poor, alone, by the river, pouring sweet wine?



SONG OF AN OLD GENERAL

When he was a youth of fifteen or twenty,
He chased a wild horse, he caught him and rode him,
He shot the white-browed mountain tiger,
He defied the yellow-bristled Horseman of Ye.
Fighting single- handed for a thousand miles,
With his naked dagger he could hold a multitude.
...Granted that the troops of China were as swift as heaven's thunder
And that Tartar soldiers perished in pitfalls fanged with iron,
General Wei Qing's victory was only a thing of chance.
And General Li Guang's thwarted effort was his fate, not his fault.
Having received from his giver an assured promise,
He took from him everything he had covetousingly;
And bitterly resentful of the ignominious record,
He took from his messenger a lie that showed how little he paid the king.
The emperor was bitterly rebuked, his bones especially prized,
And smitten with see-how to see how he would repay his father.
...From the purple cliffs that lead to the southern lake
A river running along the misty Huai
Is throbbing with the sounds of music;
And beyond compare the heights...
But here I must leave you and fall asleep by your bed,
Because of a dream about a bird crying in the wind.


SONG OF AN OLD GENERAL

He was a youth of fifteen or twenty,
He chased a wildhorse, he caught him and rode him,
He shot the yellow-bristled Horseman of Ye.
Fighting single- handed for a thousand miles,
With his naked dagger he could hold a multitude.
Fighting single handed for a thousand miles,
With his naked dagger he could hold a multitude.
...Granted that the troops of China were as swift as heaven's thunder
And that the troops of China were as swift as heaven's thunder
And that the Emperor regretted
======================================== SAMPLE 36 ========================================
Minister Jiang has sent a message to all Houses of the Yangzi
: Confronted from the highest office,
With no friend left, and with no family to keep him company,
There is nothing like seeing the bitter heart of a hero fall
Before the horses' hoof.
In the autumn rains he bakes wild rice-beans,
At night he mows the fields of Hanyang.
...There's a poet, a songwright, but not a MP3 player
Could record the lives of more than ten thousand men,
So that a travelling circus might summon the musicians!



ON WINTER DAY

In the deck-top vase of Ye country
You still can hear the bitter heart of a hero sink
Under the weight of temporary debt.
In the autumn months you put away old eunuchs
With only a blossom to share her smile with the bridal glass.
...In the deck of a southern port-bell --
Waitress' golden hair drawn and disharmonies
Shatter pines were shovelled ten thousand at a time.
...In the lilting brow of a southern lakeside mountain the white reeds died
And the white reeds died like peas and potatoes in a row,
And at the southern border a white fisherman died like a hero.
...On the yellow light of a port-bell --
Yellow clouds are blowing toward the west --
And a snow-peak whiteasleep in the king's river.
Panting, I fill my cups with old music and long for the message,
I prayer for it NOW AND THEN with a long sigh AND YELLOW RAIN

At last I know how to receive it --
How to behold it with my eyes --
How to admire it on the yellow sky AND its white clouds --
And my tears are spent!
All else gone, all I could think of was school,
I studying architecture, playing cat or dog,
I doing homeward voyages home,
I dreaming of returning home and atoning....
I have alone a diary: 'Dreaming in tree by tree'
Eclipsing, since I climb the mountain.



TO MY BROTHER AT THE SOUTH FORT MOUNTAIN

It is quiet and quiet where your mother taught
And my father, who is white as jade,
Is smiling at his many horses.
...We both are back from the long road
Of travelling down the river....
We both were partying,
Which made us two of sweethearthood.
So I take off my sandals and my silk-screen-and take off my sandals-
And open my silk-screen and see heaven and earth shaking.
As I walk, hat me, flowers are in flight of my path.
As I sit, wine is in flight of the eye of the moon....
And so I pull back my hair- curtains and my tears run dry.
I am no more than a wave waiting in the wind.
I am now the tempestuous cloud covering the whole range of air.
I am the bitter rain upon the river.
I am the thick cloud that marks the frontiers of this world.
--Mark your words. The rulers of all the Sand Infantry
Are at peace.
! . .
Sad day finally conquers all darkness!
The war-horses of yesterday are no more!



A SONG OF A SONG LA VID

Law-abiding men of Liaoxi take to the open road.
And at dusk, down south, they never rest till the horses have left the country
And Walpurgists and pinesrace all night long.
...The War Treasury is raked with jade pennies;
The currency of the Qin Kingdom is ravenous;
The House of Han, in the corner of the city,
Is ending up in the wings again and again.
...Boats fly down Huao in the dust of night,
And grey bird's homes are littered with calls made last night....
But tonight in the Nedalia Palace the House of Han is spent
In White Wolf Furs and Imperial Enamel Skirt No. 1.


A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

 Codes of conduct have changed;
King of Wei has died, his House broken to gold;
The Premier of Sha is sick, is in a foreign place,
And the City of Silk is seized by the great Red-Navy.
Do not wash your hands on your imperial tomb nor your empire sways either with resentment.
Thinking of me, walk in the palace gate of starry night.



A SONG OF A WANSHAN

The ruler of Wu lived long ago, passed great generations,
His white mountain-ruler tan he bearded,
His grey porcup

On my way to the dance of war,
I find your dance complete;
I wave my hand and thank you,
And head for the finish, back again.



A SONG OF LIANGZHOU

My red hair was the peak of one waterfall,
But instead of scaling the blue sky,
I have been tending a sickly petaltee
To which springs another passion --
Asythia.


A SONG OF THE SPRING PALACE

My sister-in-law, pregnant with child after child,
Will come across here by day and flower by night,
With her handkerchiefs undone, she says,
Looking for her son in the darkness....
But no sister, not my mother, yet, anywhere,
Yet all day in the rain of winter,
Watching the same yellow line of clouds that circle the river;
And while shew by yellow line, "Which direction eastward?"



ON THE LOCHRON

There go the spring-colours of the south sun and of the spring-Cloud
Of yesterday while flowers are still -
And while the Wu border post celebrates Florida by moon and dust.
On the yellow line we have the golden years;
The blue we have the rain.
On the orange we have the swirl of spring.
On the red we have the star of last night.


ON THE WALL OF AN INN

Time was long before I laid my head on the diamond.
At sunset I dismount on a rock,
My cuckoo feather on my mast.
My vacant temple are aflame with the passion
Of a thousand gods and goddesses setting foot in one go.
I would stand there for days without a cloud in the sky,
But...anda with her tail between my lashes, I have just seen myrtle
Ballow there by the misty Lake of the Phoenix
And into an empty river-town mysoggyrees --
Day and night I graze my meadows in the most melancholy haze.
...My supper-broker is bringing me broken wine
And a raiment that needs be torn away, pounds for divinity.



RIVER-DRINKING ADEANS

How sweet the southern rivers!
And how abundant their wine!
I drank Summer-Green my first night in town,
And found myself at the tavern-chanting.
Green was my robe and hard-boil,
And peach-black my hairpiece.
And, alone in my cabin, I was pouring them all away
When a wildgoose-dog, panting, leapt from the water,
And crumpled on the deck was my lute
And a lute artist's lantern.
We rowed away from the tavern-chant to the bar-keeper
And began our evening at the western end of the town
Where the river is running our wine.
And as the hour wore on we were quieting our spirits,
Running for our cups in the quiet distance.
Then, when we had mingled and disdained one another
And were exchanging blows as in a duel,
One of us was a danger to friends and kin;
The other a boon to the passions of many.
So we changed horses and drove out across the country;
And at twilight we parted from one another,
As we had been drinking for days....
At new beginnings new trouble arose,
As fresh fireflies ripening the startle of a garden withered.
We two had been looking forward to a long journey,
But was made prisoner of circumstance
As our ferry-boat and trailer, soon withered,
Many of us lost our way and were pursued
By vagrant water-peasants and rampant wildgoose.
...When decked out in splendor by the rivers and the mountains,
We white-haired and skinny and gayly could hold a fish and a drone
And could dance our parts like unicorns;
But being blind to the beauty of freestanding costumes,
We embroider our costumes in gold and silver thread.
And at nightfall do we thread our webs of crystal,
To attract the quick-witted eye of spring.
...Our chosen symbolizes life after the Lancelot;
But with eyes that are glued to patterns never seen before,
These Dragons and Geese were never far in the wind.
And I, the master, am I too talented
To weave these exquisite garments.
Mint-flowers never hurt my heart....
World peace is at an end, old age unutterable.


CHENG QIN'S SONG

The jade-white water has started over a rebellion,
And wildgeese are whimpering on the water.
Long ago, when the rebels were still young

TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE POEM OF ADRIFT

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, brothers and sisters have been scattered.
The fall of the Gongsunzi Palace in late April has forever been an event.
Lu and I had little faith in a meeting-place of neighbours,
Yet as rains came the bleakness of the spring deepened my heart.
Since then, having received from the Emperor his most gracious favour,
I have been going out of the world in search of news.

In the evening rain, coming from the west, vast lakes and woods,
I drove up by the capital of Chinese spring,
Wherever the cloud had blown by the southern city.
And, because of the great trees' importance,
I ornamented the frame with cypresses and reeds,
And, because of the purple of the Emperor's house,
Flower-waxes and lanterns fell like snow from the sky,
And, panting, I pulled off my coat and, holding it in my other hand,
Strode toward the western gate.


IN THE ISLAND OF THE WANDERING GENIE

By the southern winds of the Lake of the Green Giant,
I have conquered the Wall Kingdom;
I have driven the Persian sea-mound;
And I have bounded the Zunian peak.
But, before I carry on my own travelling,
I must send some of my men away.

The Westward Fields are Thefts of Mankind,
Through mist and fog and cloud and sea and sky and horizon and colour of the water;
I who am a greater worth
And am hiding in unseated prleeons,
May waken tomorrow morning all those tears for myself
And my own life of perdition.


SPRING RAIN

While rivers and peaks are flowing like a wind in the chilly sky,
Far Red in the Mountain-Tower, Green in the Mountain-Tower, Flying Machines Sing!
Lords of the west, sharp like a sun,
Grasses of the south, little like our town,
Are searching the night for hiding-place.
We are passing by a tall tall building
With a lonely pine-tree at the heart of it.
There are no more Lu clan homesick wives;
There's no one like her son.


LINEN ALI

Winter is cold and long in the Mountains of Nanjing,
And tears have gone down the cheeks of all my girls.
I am lying forlorn in the northern hills,
While my sister Claremonies about to graduate.
I am dreaming of flowers and clouds and the moon and the moon and the spring-wine.
...My western gate has opened into the River of Heaven,
And bubbling in the Qiyi Sea of spring, white clouds....
Ledges of jungle lead eastward into Wu;
Bamboos fill with the Gold Mountain, and Lake Dongting
Are like floating islands in the mid-mists of clouds.



THE YELLOW CRANE

From a great blue crane,
Through a gateway of mist,
We have passed the Yellow Crane country,
Leaving behind him nothing but shadowy boulders.
He that digs in these craters sees beyond;
He that digs in these craters
He that made us dream in the dusk of night.

North of us are towering pine and white acorns,
South us white wildgeese,
And east of the Stone Mirror are creeping lutes.
Dare I, South of me, blush, pale with autumn,
When I see a yellow crane land on the banks of a river,
And snow-shoals break on the mists below.
...When shall I reach the town where I live? /Numb My heart
Is for the Shengmen, the farmers who have eaten the few flocks they can save,
And for the Prince of Great Power, the fury of his generals.
...Oh, Misty fields and yellow clouds,
When he has driven his way through the teeth of the Tartars' premier,
With the girth of his seven horses he has swept the River of Heaven.
...The grasses have welcomed him with a song of dew,
The flags boweongoing like rivers;
The Rectangular Palace has invited you
Through a thousand gates its chilling high noon.
...Prince, if you shall be faithful,
Keep from departing any further waters of the war.


A SONG OF A GIRL

"My name is Emily, and I dance a long harp"
======================================== SAMPLE 39 ========================================
Together, they cry, wept through the night
Because they know it to be false.
...Night has darken now by dawn the Temple of the Great Holy Ghost
In a green dreary mist, far colder than snow.
Led by distant clouds, we cross winding sky
For air on clear autumnal day in the holy of holies
Gates of blueness open wide to my private viewing.
My cloudy glance is cut off by a dense bush
Where lone wolves have not yet parted the forest;
And distant birds are deaf to our whimper.
...I am quartered in a heavenly cell;
And no one in the darkness would dare approach me.


A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the Temple of the Great Premier stands an ancient cypress
With a trunk of green bronze and a root of stone.
The girth of its white bark would be the reach of forty men
And its tip of kingfish-blue is two thousand feet in heaven.
Dating from the days of a great ruler's great statesman,
Their very tree is loved now and honoured by the people.
Clouds, when I look back, grieve for those who are lost.
...II Egypt: A Lesson in Mirrored Carved Mirror Star
For China's Northern Flags, Painted in Heaven,
Beside the Temple of the Great Premier, Are Mounted in the Woods.
Clouds, when I look back, grieve for those who are honoured.



A SONG OF THE PALACE

Beside the Palace of the King of Yangfordshire
Are palace walls blue, the Premier's Palace is pink,
The two Towers in the Palace's courtyard, Star of the two Mighty Gods,
Here I watch the Emperor ride his jet-boat,
And the Palaces families fishing in the calm of the river.
...What does it matter that street after street is dotted with red flowers?
I wish I could go back in time and look the way you did,
Till we met again and bought a cup of wine?



ON THE TERRACE OF ASSEMBLED ANGELS I

The sun has gone slanting over a lordly roof
And red-blossoming branches have leaned toward the dew
Since the Emperor last night summoned a new favourite
And Lady Yang's bright smile came through the curtains.
...But power can never bring its enemies its glory.
Turning to confront the man who had vanquished the great Emperor
And pointing a bow in the Ruler's direction,
Weaved through the thousand-horse aching list,
We've tacked on the words of an exile,
And at the Emperor's Court a pair of jade armour
Dressed in silken garments came the rosy-flowing song of the wildgoose.
...No wonder I long for the true meaning of the flag
Of last night's flood and today's drunken river.


ON THE TERRACE OF ASSEMBLED ANGELS II

The Queen of Sun City faces the bleak mountain
And dagger in hand urges her to dance !
The Jade-Fleet sails beyond while the autumn moon
And girdles her spurs like a great dragon.
...But would she care if she caught a cold wind,
Or would linger till the dust settled,
Watching the river coming and the red waters moving by?
...Long years of discontent have not quite satisfied
The feverish call of Queen Yinghoort --
And new questions strike her once more
As she studies the patterns of a dragon's dance
And dragons move even before dawn.



TALL in the dust are royal palaces, terrace mansions
And in the bright moon of a dragon's flame, ten royal chambers are
Flowery with cloud and rain, with spring glimmer and moth a swirl,
With the flower between a dragon's wing and his only friend;
A dragon-beard, moon-boughs heavily pursed,
Dragon-horse neighs on the ground, before a column of bats
Except for a slow dragon-air tempest,
Can ever guard the City of Silk from the flying storm.
...Though an emperor wearttest clothes of gold,
Though a Flying Robber be sent to steal them,
Though a King's paws brim his Thertle-Bird Duster his nine-panelled Great Cannon.
...There were other kings, but none like the Emperor these days!

And in the bright moon of a dragon's flame, ten royal chambers are

Sleeping Beauty comforts a Chinese Princess at the Gate of Green Jade
After a night of revelry at the western waterfall,
Brings a shower of tears to the naked traveller.
The tear-drops are like a monk's robe shaking with rain;
Rain is chilling the air of Lake Dongting.
The Yunmen celebrate the birth of their Prince.
...Brethren, join me, I pray, and we can heal our men;
We can lodge our tents in the wall of the ancient temple,
Free from the yoke of white corduroy;
We can drink the mountain air with our drums,
We can watch the high moon rise and set sail for the North Star.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Having found her rendezvous point in the fount of blood,
Melancholy with the long grasses and the winding river,
The girl from Yuegeen lies in the corner looking at a loathsome river.
Her tattooed wildgoose, from the Dragon Lake swamp,
Leaves o'erwhelm the tall phoenix from the Fairy God Woods.
Her green-blossoming sword is sweet with romance,
And strings are fondling her slender snatch
When, before her cloud-blue eyes, she sees a freer light pouring from underground
And, satisfied, she joins in the revelry, enjoying
The lake's bounty.


ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where, before her, were the ages of dance and trickery?
Her round form is vivacious, her whole being grows dark
And she leans on a cordial hairpin, her gaze fixed on the bright moon
And that, below the silken fur of the peach, the two butterflies
Which, together with her, become the symbol of spring.


ON A TEMPLE AT SHU

Where, before her, were the ages of dance and trickery?
Her round form is flowered in silken by the flow of the garden,
Her head down in a seated study, her contemplation complete,
She has her books and her poems in her robes her palms on her jade plumed staff.
Her mind's desire is neutral, no matter what the other books
And brief vices are forgetful of time.


AT HIBISCUS INN

The goddesses-in-waiting
Peach-trees magical with buds floating in the morning
Sift on the high-flowing water, sea-gulls, crab-ites, fugitive butterflies,
Humongous robes, which had been concealed in a vast cold;
Theists throw forth the fetishes of the experts;
Fengism and Taoism are shades of the same flower.


A SONG OF THE HANKARTAIN

The year is 1937, and the Emperor is in the Lake District.
He is hard at work digging in the snow.
People are serving in the Tank and the Horse Guard.
The fur traders at Kuanqiu are gathering red-chocolate to fill their world.
The ruler of China is bitterly sobbing.
Sad to find that my master, for all his hard work,
Does not have enough, he sends him Prince Jia'u Gong.
And what are you thinking of, Liu Qing?


Back in the world of inklings, the happy Emperor is preparing for war.
The people are proud and happy and proud of their Emperor.
They bury him alive in the pit of a sixth-lute.
...How may he please the League of the Red Phoenix,
While his generals babble petty matters in the nine-panelled machine?


Back in the world of inklings, the happy Emperor is preparing for war.
The imperial limpidor is about to leave the earth,
And the fur-trailers cry in the wind because of his miserable life.
...How may he please the League of the Red Phoenix,
While he broods in his nine rooms in the palace of Chu?
Preparing his messengers in formal letters, he writes nothing for years.
...While the war grows restless in the hills and the cliffs,
He lives by the chain of fences near his fishing post.


Back in the world of inklings, the happy Emperor is emptying his imperial palace,
And taxes are being paid in four courses:
Fisheries are growing in three valleys,
Borne to five-colours by the River of Heaven.
...Though a man of genius longs for the sublime,
He can never attain it even in his sleep.


Back in the world of inklings, the happy Emperor is pouring assails on the pagoda,
And building at the road the mighty Hanged Man.

THERE IS ONLY ONE –
RIVER-SNOW RIVERNIGHT

At twilight I waken from my slumber
With a crazed hope of finding the lone monk
Under the first frost-cave.


THE BEAUTIFUL XI SHI

There has been no conception since... long
That a world away, a rainbow,
Can in many ways be likened to heaven.


THE BEAUTIFUL XI

There was a time when the sky was blue;
Now it's a misty soup-stand, I hear them sighing.
...and everyone is dressed in nothing but rain....


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Last night a solemn deep in the palace-wall,
Lingering in both beauty and purple,
Walking alone in a ball, is harder than falling asleep.
Night deepens and dawns brighter-a song of spring;
And I, a stranger, who is honoured all through the night,
Hears the calling of a river-murm along the river.


THE BEAUTIFUL XII

There are sobsiding men in the shadows of the mountain-ranges
That it is almost impossible to walk on account of the wet.
...Mountains are earthly things, objects of veneration;
But they are peopleelles for the soul of a famous man.
They are sometimes painted by monks divinely appointed;
And sometimes wrought by men of the finest means.
...While the road-snow has left the pagoda-Prince Chuo
Made one wish in vain: "Xin Jiang" --
And so I take up my mace at the midnight dance
And ride it up the Great Peak, breaking the quiet of the street....


ON THE FESTIVAL OF THE MOON
TO SUB-OFFICIAL ZHANG

The fine clouds have closed over the world's
Solitary mountain-lands, and night has entered its twilight-
Stream. Beyond the southern peaks they are falling,
With twilight leaving Blue Mountain passim
I hear a mountain gull trampling the flat earth.


IN THE BORDER

The thread in the fork of the river is luring me;
Sinking westward I am looking back.
...What are the days of the year,
Up north, south, east?
I haven't eaten nor drank in ten days.


A BOAT IN SPRING

Attaining the north cloud border
Was the height of independence.
...Coalition snipers are raining death
On the Blue Star Reluctant.


A BORDER'S BURDEN

A burnt-out train comes to us from Wuzhou.
A fisherman from Chengdu comes back with a bucket of wine.
Man, you sounded old and worn out.
What are you thinking of, madame?
I remember your jade-white hair;
Yet I remember those white fish-birds flying dead
With no thought of you and of the tigers and the hawks.


FROM AN UPPER STORY

Flowers, as high as your window,
Shatter the earth, crush the sand;
Mosses add their climbing to the chaos,
And rain has locust-worshipped the Deccan.
...Suddenly your mountain falcon trills are quivering,
And the dewy bridal cry becomes a rousing one
For the bridegroom's hundred dresses, all white,
Flit to the hoof and lie breathless.


RETURNING AT NIGHT TO A BORDER-SHIRGE

In the slant of the moonlight you witness an envoy
City-gates lie idle,
No news source will bring to your village
The bitter memory of a city-state so wrecked by war.
...You workers here bear no ill will toward home.
The temple-bell of Han is mewed with the dying
And tolls on the cathedrals of Nineveh.
You workers here hereota sharp questions:
"What do you wish for the feng pao?
"Tomorrow, when you bring me rice and wine,
I will be his pupil.


COOLER'S SISTERS

A succubus named Luanvez has just turned ten years old,
And has mastered the art of flight.
...His master, the great barbarian,
Dismounts in a lake afar his beauty.
He rationed his grain at the town-gate and a temple-gate
And built a temple on the borderu,
Free from the shackles of the barbarian world.
He swept the plain from the yellow of the spring mountains
And built his city on the borderu,
The centre of the heavenly light.

ON SEEING WANG LEAVE FOR THE SOUTH

Henceforth I turn Home, Leaving my Lord of the Roses Alone.



TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS

So sad a dawn as drops of rain on the river
Andists two of the bridgemen palely
Andists both drunk and sad.
Heart's content with spring, where its blossoms fall;
But why should I be troubled with long delays?
As in the past
Hope is born of life and of happiness,
Andismatavists round and about,
Doubtless
Those who believe in the Light of Heaven.


INSCRIBED IN THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING GENIE

I face, high over this enchanted lodge, the Court of the Five Cities of Heaven,
Where the seasons do not permit them the beauty of fairies,
Andists two rustling afire under the crescent-shaped Pool.
...Let me begin by pointing out a few points.
The Realm of Heaven is divided into three quarters;
The northern templewest of two mountains;
The southern one taken up by a harbour;
And the former kingdom the Mountain of the Westward.
...Both are founded on the same root;
But the Northern Kingdom has two clouds;
The South has a mountain of the sun and a mountain of the moon.
...I reflect, from my northern palace,
On the high egrets, at your building-stones everywhere.



THE SKETCHING OF THE SPRING GATE

When my grandmother was so young
She played the flute in the late Autumn Moon,
And stirred the River of Heaven by her holy sun,
And stirred the Three Gorges of peace, justice, and blessings.
When her husband, a Knight of the Golden Tortoise,
Bounded by the moon and the Great Moon,
Through the magical Gate of Bliss
Through the Enchanted Mountain of Bliss,
I harnessed my light-blue hair-and, wi' gaylongs,
Strode to the Magic Mountain of the Forbidden City
And sat at the foot of a long drawn horse
And whirred the roughhills of Carmichael every night.



THE MOON AT THE GATE OF REFLECTION

Where tender grasses rim the day
And agonizing slow Ghosts of the Moon follow,
I was led to a certain high-backed figure
Holding a spear, a staff, fighting the darkness.
...The gate, the camp, the camps,
My path is knotty, yet no way out!



A FARM-HOUSE ON THE WEI RIVER

In the slant of the sun on the country-side,
Cattle and sheep trail home along the lane;
And a rugged old man in a thatch door
Leans on a staff and thinks of his son, the herdboy.
He is tending the red-capped Chisel Wheel
In the working-horse-trees of the farm-house.
And the farmers, whose hands I had broken,
Are kind to their fields,
And nice enough to give away gold
To those who are fed.



HARMONIZING A POEM BY PALACE-ATTENDANT GUO

High beyond the Bamboo-Trees flies a POEM,
Perld with the spring wind and waving an island of grass.
The tower above him is shock, the moonlight hiss....
But I hold up a languid sad face and wonder how my dear
Can there be any who are thinking of me?


LOOKING AT A POEM BY VICE-PREFECT FOUR

The petty poacher, returning from his trip,
Adds cinnamon-tart dishes to old wine.
He is never seen again.


A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed vermilion steps,
To be parted by the purple walls....
Our flag, with its ornate coronet,
Is one with the leaves of November;
It is resting beneath a palace-village littered with flowers.
...Reservations from officers alarm me.

This morning the palace-village rains down weeds.
Rest assured that your gallant officers will not trample us!
I will continue my good office,

A CONFESSION

With little trouble my party has won the day.
With many a sigh
======================================== SAMPLE 43 ========================================
And --
When I dreamed of sailing, of fishing,
Of flying far, of river and sea,
Of buying a hat and riding....
Oh, if ever I dreamed I might fly,
Along the shadowy Hermitock Range!





AT HERMITAGE DONG

Near the Beginning of Spring, the Woods of Qing are full of flies, says a Voice for the Betterment of Man,
And a constant gale of wind and rain.
...Though I awake low and lazy, looking toward home,
I should like to excite your day by blowing by my Friends.
By the time I reached my window of hair, there were soapy coves in the damp grasses,
That the wick whipped up weeds like a tempest.
And, since I am an exile from my village,
From Taihe to Henan, the mountains wet my boat,
I should have a good look round the house.
Instead, I find a troupe of pirates.
Are they really the country-peasants you have to hide? --


TO VICE-PREFECTS LI AT CHANGSHA

Snow is fluttering across the Rainbow Range,
And the moon is glimmering on a crescent-shaped mountain
Which, thirty miles from here, I cannot but dread.
...After buying us wine and pledging us,
And setting sails for the eastern mountains with no ships in sight,
And setting back again a month at a stretch,
And arriving this morning in Chu,
But the year is never far from ours --
And here, beside a tall pole
And beside the river,
We have to bury our heads in.
We have to bury our heads in. Mail! -- a solemn notice, left by the clerk
And given on the first day of winter.
At midnight we close the gate and, emptying our boat,
Drive home to our guest a note of welcome.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas complain of thin mulberry-trees
In the Eighth-month chill at the frontier pass.
Through the gate, through the McCarthy-Tina shade,
Through the red light of the indigo curtain,
We have read, in the Green Books, that the Jade Pass is haunted
By the memory of the regime that has been lost
To the memory of those that have gone.
...Where is the central lonely mountain? --
I ask you where you are going, old friend,
Into the final solitude.


ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

The night is cold and the sun is in the trees,
I hear birds in the night-gate complaining.
...I have to give up tennis --
I have had enough of these cicadas.
I. The mountain is lonely and I cannot rest it's cold,
I hear birds in the night-gate.
...I. Michael G. Robey's novel of the same name is being read,
And more than meets the eye, spirits of the sea fly down.
...From Qutb Peak a misty boat races, and the warm water ants
Distill into valleys of slaughter and weeds.
Oh, when shall I gather the animals?....
The ferry-boat moves as though someone were tugging at its strings.


AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

As I pour yourself a drink at the Majhou Yu,
Zak at the Golden Gate heist, and the day goes on long after,
I am listening to a band of the Piets de Lubavitcherie.
...The city-gate opens and I see a flashing green river
Along the wall of the Imperial Palace a thousand imperial spells are gleaming.
...The troops of China are idle, foreign sacrifices are being washed
In the most ancient Chamber of Rank.
My superior, my comrade, I sing your Green Bartender's Song --
All night in the rain the melody is echoing
In the Palace of the Red Carcassieu.


PARTING I At the front, where us Sailors
Are sleeping, we find at ground-level
That oh so rare a chance to fly a newflying bird.
And, after advancing a thousand hills and valleys,
Up a thousand peaks and valleys,
Up a thousand clouds to glimmer all night on the horizon.
...We lie, thinking of our beaches,
Over Piccadilly Green and down another one
Where the river meets the sky and the moon is with her.
And, because of our great height, our boats cannot ease
Up the countless pines and ridges.

To express our sincere thanks by recording the name of theodorous poems.

And our formalities with men of high position
Which are almost as rare as the Emperor's.

Be gentle with us, as we have been busy preparing,
And be ready when the time comes to rebukements.

A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the Temple of the Great Premier stands an ancient cypress
With a trunk of green bronze as across the moon
As in a screen of dewy wax, waiting for the spring sun.
The girth of its white bark would be the protection of a father's finger,
But not the master's.
Dreading the length of its space, it may be said to be small:
But that of its bark it grows, every three or four cypress
Which soon becomes the centre of the earth.
...When the rich and famous are anxious about you,
Dance with your cypresss as its harp dies in the dinner-hall.
Go out and cavort with your cuckoos, bashful at the gossip;
And never shall you fail to be alert for a return call.



A SONG OF DAGGER-DANCING TO A GIRL-PUPIL
OF LADY GONGSUN


There lived years ago the beautiful Gongsun,
Who, dancing with her dagger, drew from all four quarters
An audience like mountains lost among themselves.
Heaven and earth trembled as she drew near,
And River-Clouds glimmered on her cloak.
But no child of her younger brothers could understand words,
And her elder brothers, with whom she had no acquaintance,
Had to watch her die young.
Her dancing-fires became hot and roared,
As she watched her shimmering naked through the darkening clouds,
And every step she took was witnessed by the distant hills;
...How dancing-cups make a boy gay by his drying --
And how to ward off colds and fizzles
Came to be sought at the minor leagues.
She found out from the local priest that girls were flown by the wind,
And that in time of peace they could become parents.
Held here by a sacred trust
To carry them, frees from taxes the profits of all
And taught by true teachers, they came to be the fashion of the town
And are only the token of true age.
...High tea is ordered, here by the decrepit official,
To be had at the temple from the priests who are full
In numbers now of more than forty, to be exacted.
And aJOURNEY AS OF NOW TO THE FIRST TIME BOUND

In the wind of dawn on the mountain for joy in the autumn sea,
I lean by a hand and whisper to my horse
That early in the morning gusts are to danger her of mountains;
And later in the day the cold approaches by which I watch her
And, troubled, I cry for her to say what is happening
And where heaven's loyally inclined
Don't you also love her so very?
...After a long journey home, we have met again.
We were both so changed that hearing would have cleared the mind;
And hearing, if it served your happiness, patience)
How to find your lost love in a place of quietness --
And how to find your lost love
In a place of quietness which is neither

During the rainy season, when the river is running clear,
Where willows be shade, crescent-shaped grasses fill with the rain?

The simplest of these, he who is inclined toward wisdom,
The deeper is the mist.
Gets harder for marches toward the southwest.
Long years of battle! Oh, why so brave in the dawn?
In spite of grey hairs, horses' hoofs are plump,
And furs are sewn on the horses' coats for protection.
...What about the men of the Empire, risking their lives?
Tarrying in a world of cloud and rain, they will make a mockery of horses
If they stay at all at night.


A WORLD IN WHICH WARMING IS STILL ANTIGRAINED

How many soldiers can hold a single throne?
Even a single grain of rice.

And the country will be dark with fight and truce.

The barbarian visitor here knows nothing of the true cause of Emperor Wu,

Exhibit after example of love lost.

And sweet from their belles the songs of Feng and Lu,
And the fighting cicadas came to be a constant sight.
War-fires of the past and the sounding of the sword

Till at dusk, when the war-drums will no longer be warm

The government dead or not, and the people hungry

TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been busy in the Moon Chamber.
At the same time as my lords and gentlemen were visiting the Planet of the Stars,
Collaborating as nations did in the days of Han,
We had the honour of officiating in the Imperial Dragon Coat and the Golden Horse,
And, clad in the tribute of celestial glory, flying in the east,
The Grand Wizard announced the Expedition Titles to the Ruler of Zou.

...Our number was service-initially Great and Little Brothers,
When Li Yan, the wise and studious General, deserving his title of Premier,
Inquires princes to consult in the Hall of the Lords of Rend,
Whose duty it would be a festival of the south!
We honored the favour with our divinity-cups,
Our Prince Jia was kind to his Prince of Friends --
And our petals were breeze both with their sweet furs
And at midnight we lost interest in the Solar System.
At a great loss for words, I think I have quoted Jia Yi,
The Proclamation of the Emperor in Time of War.
...Separation from my parents
Remind me why I abandoned you so young
And how I battle over spinach and steward it for you.


GENERAL GE SHU

You are now dead, sad and old:
Lay awake all night in a net-town
And no one cares for your sad voice.
...The tribute-place of the midnight stars is sealed
And you forget the brush that moved you-a blanket that no one cares for
When your pale body lies by a roadside covered with bitter tears.



A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

"Tell me, where do you live?
In this world after this one;
Or is life really that strange?
When the travelling is over, where shall we be tonight?"


I wake with a long sigh, and find my friends and I alone.
The road is dark with coarse fog:
The stars and cloud grow cold in the dusk,
And the high brim of a tall lantern wanes.
...It is certain that with the years come new troubles
And the difficulty of living in this far world.
I climb to a bough where wildgeese are flying every day.
I see people at Kearney crossing the sea.
I see people in China selling shrimp in the warm river.
...I climb to a bough where wildgeese are selling duck in the warm sky.
I see people in the South Pole selling melons in the sun.
...I climb to a bough where wildgeese are throwing fishing-nets --
And my rosy-flowing wine is rewarded with a catch!
...Whoops, there's a sound of cicadas
Playing for rouge.



A SONG OF A GIRL

There's a girl in his dreams, a lute is playing
Two guitars chime with minute and long notes.
...She is slim and trim and has a face of jade.
On the height of her languor, she cries and clutches a basket of wine;
And at twilight she wanes from her duties by a sadness of rain.
...Her mother is away, away from her sisters;
And with time she shall grow thin and pale,
With her lungs saccharine and her chariot black with the rain.



THE BEAUTIFUL XI SHI

The long road ahead will be like the wintry nights.
Night-shadees everywhere are pink and inflamed,
 Cars are slowing, people stopping in their tracks.
...The ruler of Shu stretches his hand out toward the North.
Chang handed Shu his thunderbolt, and the Emperor rode aside.
Fire-flies are comical now and then,
Many hills and traversing are troubled with blossom-bugging.

But no flowers of pure flood plain.
They ask me where

Flowers are short,
And a quiet night
Sees through the mists of the river.
I am floating as high as heaven
And am pausing to wife the lone Zagros,
As I ski here with you.
Spin a hundred pieces of jade,
All of them are now lost,
And here in the quiet of the street I live a poor life.
...Who knows but me about the past,
Or where the bright red of the spring-sun comes into my day?
I am ashamed to share my fame
With people who are not my friends.



TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT

With sadness in the low cloud,
Through the morning you have visited my bright- coloured house,
Which I have laid aside till yesterday.



THE INLAID HARP

I am a flute-player.
I am a country girl.
I sing a great many songs,
Which, though my voice sounds like those of an actual player,
I have no part in or understanding.
...Why not come along and see me in your bright- coloured cabin,
And, lo, if possible, come along and join in the song,
Even if it be silence and slow since yesterday?



THE LUTE WITH A LUTE TO LUTE DONG

Now that the strings have started through a grove,
The strings have ceased their final bends,
And the slow notes have entered the final grove....
Peach-trees have been blown up, banks of water are strewn;
Lakka-trees are trillies in the morning noon bell;
In the evening rain the leaves are in bud;
In the powder-flame the sun has set no wildflowers;
In the slanting moon there is no sunset,
But in real-time watching for your chariot --
Oh, for the Country of the Light headed east!



The sun has set in the misty Cenotaph and guttering grows redder,
While at night bats and rosy birds flock together.
Into the North Winding Gate, through which daisies are barred,
And west leaps the white dawn....
There are no brave women in the North Star,
Male and female only, young and old.
They who have lived all their lives may not envy
Yet they insist on cutting the flowers
For this symbol of union between the sexes.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME
ON THE CHU RIVER

A cold light shines on the heavy fog of battle,
With sunlight entering Maoli yellow beyond repair,
And sword and shield worn by the thousands now stand,
On the frontier between heaven and earth.
The vanquished are left battered and withered;
But soldiers who had once held such a high claim
Are merely relics of time.
...After the war-fires of two reservoirs west-east had ended,
And the capital of China stooped tamely
While Premier Wen was thinking of a new lute,
Lingering in the Five Lakes were these ruddy guitars:
Ledges of green light like the Jin River,
With yellow beams of golden light banked on the clouds
Flow like two rivers of water, like the border of two rivers.
...The war-horses of Loyang, departing from Chengdu,
With their drums beating for the capital,
Came from Yan in a rowboat.
North of us are yellow hills and west of us are wet plains.
...I sing a plaintive song of lonely states-
Boundless a dream comes over me,
When I watch the Bright Hills glow with the River of Heaven.


ON THE BORDER

With a clear mind, awake from dream,
You have dreamed everything.
You have told in silence the Worldsui palace.
We both are doomed to fade beyond our memory.
But now, with the opening of the North Star,
With the Summer Moon against the clouds like a wingspan of shadow
And the Giant Peach like a single dream,
When shall we lie again and fade away?


A MONOGROMENDED VIDEO

Here at home I watch a video-game,
Confusing as the sounds are of it,
And then to find you, with slanting sunlight,
And next to me the sound of a tower collapsing.
...When shall I be hearing again again,
All night in the city-gates watching the tournament
Fallen by the Kyrgyz lute?


Cui Hao

WHEN LU LUN MY COUSIN COMES FOR THE NIGHT

With no other neighbour but the
======================================== SAMPLE 48 ========================================
I turn at the foot of the pass, and see a mist that enters a cave --
For men of earth are born drowsy, insatiably lazy,
And no more than monkeys can food-gave.
...The blue sky is full of new information,
And hungry children are riding the lute-string.
...In an endless sea of rain, fresh with the floattea,
The characters on the strings sound like coral,
And the sound of a person in the air grows and darkens,
Panting and looking around.
Fornication is no help to the naked eye,
Borne by wind and dust,
And the abundant native-seed-pea.
...But I have come, after all the trouble,
And here on the Huai, singing my poem,
How to find my lost friend.


ON CLIMBING YAN MOUNTAIN WITH FRIENDS

While worldly matters take their turn,
Ancient, modern, to and fro,
Rivers and mountains are changeless in their glory
And still to be witnessed from this trail.
Where a fisher-boat dips by a waterfall,
Where the air grows colder, deep in the valley,
The monument of Yang remains;
And we have wept, reading the words.


AN AUTUMN TRIP TO AN MYLD FENG TRAIL
INING AN OLD FRIENDS

Here, east of the pass where your friend left you,
Seemed destined to fly:
But boat and chariot and horse and pony
Mean a thousand different things.


CHANGING ON OLD FRIENDS IN A VILLAGE INN

While ancient friends were hauling stone and dust,
Today they are doing the same of ours.
If only we called them old friends,
We would raise our voices and complain.
Old friends, who were so busy guarding
The pass where your friend went,
Are fleeing eastward toward a dangerous land.
...Who knows if they will come back?


A FAREWELL TO LI DUAN

This is a day when the heart of a great poet
Lives in peace in the shadow of swift water.
Its beauty can be found only on the nearby wall;
And yet still among the flowers you see young men
Running, jumping, tossing about,
Has every fibre of theirs served to warn
His-and his friend's running and jumping!



A FAREWELL TO WANG LIAN

The Jade Parrot

Is Pekingese for Windhelm.
Its girth makes the hand of a Phoenix large
And Great it is to see the Twin Peaks Cities.
...Where can he go without crossing the Grand border,
With his fingers like a fish in a rainbow?


AN AUTUMN TRIP TO A MOONLIGHT

A lamp is back at the palaceside door,
And the farmers go to town planting pines and wheat.
The imperial flu has sent a thunderbolt
And wildgeese are flying all night in the gusty wind.
...The farmers have nothing to fear, they are just enjoying life!
But there's something wrong doing what is right....
And what is right without a bad breath?



A MESSAGE

I am the Camp Mountain Messenger.
Ever since the spirits of the wild west
Challenged the old ways of the gold rush,
The two armies who were trying to free us
Are side by side now and one of them is crying,
 'Go Backtrack!'


THROUGH THE YELLOW RIVER

In the shadows of carven trees, near a old inn,
I try to read a friend's writ while we are out of town,
But he only lets us hear sways and thumps
And willows our swords down cold.


ON CLIMBING YAN GAN

Yielding tons of rice a day,
I have been careless in my food;
I might serve you for a moment's peace,
But I have enough now to eat ten cups of wine.
...Then when I am all of three,
Why complain when someone is hungry?


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

A candle-party is casting,
And the cold in the river-gate
Stones of spring birds echo.
...When I am all of three,
Why not just come home and rest?


A NIGHT-MOORING SONG

How green the water is in this river- bay --
And how quiet my sail!
For now, Leigh's maid, her madcap hat,
Tarrying the Maoris to the Lake of the Sun,
Has frozen my heart against snow.
...I stroke her on her lightly and fond
======================================== SAMPLE 49 ========================================
And evening at dusk in the quiet of the street clothes the dust of weapons;
Markes, in the alcohol-spattered pot,emark the battle;
And ready for overtimes any of his foes may pose,
He sees the white line of the rugged mountains ahead.
The day will end, the river's near,
The mountains long ago lacerated.
...Night in the tall trees opens the way for adventure;
Clouds and the river come to us from the South Garden.
...I will tether my horse to a hut along the river
And wait for the will of some one to come along the misty....
Scouts, thunderclips, lsutans, gaols, homing in swifthoof,
Flower-thirsty insects wane in the evening wind.
Our messages are vain as ashes lost in the deep mountain:
... perhaps eastward I may venture to a fishing-town
Where the head of an aquatic still lives.


A SONG OF RUNNING-HORSE RIVER IN FAREWELL
TO GENERAL FENG OF THE WESTERN EXPEDITION

All that is happening in the world, run you to withingealls
Where you came from.
...Tomorrow you must return to Wuzhou.



OTHER POORITIES IN FAREWELL

RIVER OF FIRE

Lin and Doug Xin lived in Farwick,
Both of them girls and young at heart.
They had just left the town of Xizhou,
When the fortune of the north meant that all gold was gone.
...to be blooming again would be a matter of lifetime.
So they took off their coats and dyed them red,
Flat-hanging; a course was in sight.
But at dusk, knowing that the wildgeese were beating,
And the river was running wild,
They bade all passers-by see the palace in appearance,
Where, in the murk of the crane, Queen Elizabeth II....
House in palace of the king of kings
Is painted in the capital red with @adam\",
While the countryside is blanketed in snow.
...May the cause of one-eyed protector
Be able to sweep the floor of the Qin Kingdom!



A SONG OF THE WHITE COURSE

Just finishing high school, I came to the eastern court
Wherech by one-sided gate how I waited for the other court
That months on the snowy mountain, never departing....
I wondered if my modeling dreams were right with China
If, like me, you two were to go on a run in the high clouds,
And fall short of funding my studies,
Instead, you two would mount a great attack!



A SONG OF THE PALACE OF LIGHT

Oh, if only her beauty be as high as the sky
And never return would be uninvict
Of royal jade and not be known as Princess
By her lofty face!


BLACKTAIL ROW

When the tide was in her direction, she would float her white sail
In the breezes of dawn, just for the colour of sunshine;
But queried about her beauty, she would only say she was of good cheer;
And would gladly take people by the boat when her rain-clouds broke,
So that few noticed....
When she turned back home, taking things with her,
She flaunted her royal jade among the crowd,
And would pierce the jade of the fleeing guest
And slay the royal dragon with little warning,
While holiday-girls Rae and Yui headed north.



A SONG OF LIANGZHOU

I am the holder of a scepter of silver.
I play the flute and guitar.
I dance the guitar manfully.
...Until a golden- daisy- trident leaves the court of China
Dip among courts of nobles and slaves.
How wide the world has wide !
And how house and palace have reason toight
And knit their brows today.


A SONG OF LIANGZHOU

I am the master of Chinese guitar.
I have played it many a time.
...I like the sound even more than the instrument.
It flutes high and drums down elation-
Even the Red Pine- is twinkling in the wind.
There are trees that shade city-villages and phoenixes --
And there are phoenixes that sing when the Lightning Toads The-Pure Qi Gather.



THE HAN MONUMENT

The Son of Heaven in his late teens worked as a pauper.
He picked wild plum-trees and sweetewed swallow-ways often in the morning
And placed swallow-way after swallow-way before palaces and mansions
======================================== SAMPLE 50 ========================================
And for a storm in the south-west gate,
By the wildgeese' cry of the chickens,
Fleets of monkeys fly up to the misty gate,
And children of the sandhods see kings, mountain and river,
And wildgeese all night long flying home.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

"Tell me, where do you live? --
Near here, by the ferry?
Let's hold our boats together
And see where the King's ships are headed.


A SONG OF GORGES ON THE WESTERN MOUNTAIN

"I am an Indian living in Ch'ang-kan.
I move only when north and south diverge.
I am always thinking of China.
What are the King and Queen like like at Ch'ang-kan?
They are all here already.



A SONG OF WHITE SNOW IN FAREWELL
TO FIELD-CLERK WU

War-torn northern China looks like snow.
On the river a bridge flies white as snow;
On the mountain a lone wolf urges its way
Confident that he knows better than to chase after unicorns.



A SONG OF WINTER BEAUTY

In the enchanted night a candle is cast,
Wherech by chameleon a note of incense
Dismounts on a dragon's tail.


 DRAGUAY RAIN TO LI DUANMOUN

Moonlight has gone, beyond the southern mountains,
Through mist and fog to the border of Shenfield.
In the fading sunlight a wild bird in misty sails
Discovers a girl of the mountains, a little boy of the waves,
Who, alone and far away, never goes to see you.


A MESSAGE

I am the artist on the run from the vengeful.
I am ever vigilant in my pursuit.
... Welcome to Wu-t'ang.
A temple of the Holy Ghost has been built
Among the quiet gardenia-sesangs of the old wall.


BEYOND SEEING

A troupe of heroes locates YAN*SANG

Pacifica Man, the greatest of them all.
The Yellow Emperor, resplendent in military glory,
Is descended from the Purple-Garden's three premiers.
...The premiers are suit-de-siels,
The Third Army's two great commanders,
With hundred victories and a hung government.
The people have only one Kaiju:
And none of them can hope for another,
Venturing as far as Japan.


THE TEMPLE OF THE WANDERING GENIE

Time has not yet vanquished the will of the Emperor
To settle the court of the five Ranked Gardens.
The court is large and imposing,
The hallcothoses' iron gates hissy.
But the will of the Creator manifests how to love those he loves
Those who have seen the Cross.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Her tears are cold and her voice is low
While he listens in the twilight to the plea of the Chinese traveller,
Who has only seen heaven and earth ringed by the moon,
And has forgotten the reason why.
...The PALACE OF THE PALACE III

Blood has suddenly become a screen upon the Palace of Bliss
Where Sunshine is dancing on Blossom-Leaves.
The Princesses bow before one another,
Pointing to one another at variance.
Confident, they restore each other's bows.
And the ABBEY SamaISHI

Into the final solitude.


ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
THinking only of his bride, hefting no discontent himself,
Flower- wizards of the world gather.
The Emperor gives her the ring
And begins to survey the newlywanted Island of Blue-Snow.
The travellers' hearts pound with happenstance
And night-glories flash before their eyes....
When she sees him washing the line of sheep by the ferry,
He is smiling, brightening the river's dark clouds.


ON THE WALL OF WINTER MADHEW

Time was long before I showed her the Tomb of Morsel,
But she heard footsteps behind her closed doors.
And when morning-glories were abruptly lifted,
The old Lady leapt, bending before her Master;
And dressed in autumn frocks every handmaid's runook,
She offered the flowers before his eye,
And waved her wand to welcome him,
And sang the guestbook to lure the perps.

And a girl of the western capital has no dreams,

======================================== SAMPLE 51 ========================================
The Millennium Falcon lifted off from Han City
For the Emperor's sake, fly home, for the flag of Great Power.
His friends and foes had sailed before he began,
And Dragon City was a place of hiding
And night came to the Dragon Lake willows
And the Tang Desert rim was a desolate blue.
...When he set his harvester, all alone,
He found his chance pupil soaring,
With his lute piece by piece his seeing pupil.
And when he fitted his model train
And started his skiffed sail toward the east,
He found the water so cold and the clouds dark that he could not see his friends.
...The sand below the sand carry so much dust
That even a ducklee bird can barely fling it.
And yet we think of You, the Emperor, in the distance!


We hear a voice at sunset, loudly calling
That all children of Israel are born into a good family,
That men of high rank leave the earth and make their way home,
That the air of Kisang gate grows thick with the start of spring,
And the soldiers of the Spring Raid come pouring in.
...What are a people like,
Who at the Yin Pass battle adulthood energetic
And still cannot control their fury.
...Chan Gan, your honoured friend, is now dead
And his spirit is floating in the blue dusk.
You were able to care for your own poor body
And had the will to rule an empire beyond compare.
You had the strength to carry out your will;
You lost the will to carry out your will.
...In an endless pit of blood and fatigue,
Mankind has been bereft of a government official.
Your Highness Yang enjoys evening-in
With her long legs along the bank of a stream.
By the evening of that night, a thousand locks of hairpins
Tops the door in her of blue cloud and moon, and breaks the cold frost.
Her shadow is seen through the curtains of a guest house
And the Autumn Moon smiles on the White Wolf.
Her shadow, wishing she could see all night in the dark,
Drags a rosy-flowing rain-and-abrarley
Along the bank toward Mu Yu.
...Like drops of rain on a spring-green sky,
Zhou Yu windps and wuks under her thin coat
And the mists of the lake return through the night,
Perch like a cocoon before her, unprotected from the sun.
...And the first snow to fall in nine months,
Her shadow, brighter than ever, entering the palace,
Shines pure from ear to ear.
Her green limpid cloud, pondering spring,
Is never more than a moth an neighbour sees.
Her endless butterflies changing places behind a fence,
Are all but white under the moonlight.
...Her divinity hovering beside a deep pine,
And the pure spring pouring over a balcony,
Are just as at the western mountain
And yet at the eastern one-down ladder.
The white cord is lifted, like a string,
And the red flower moves on the flowers.
Into the long cold river,
To be parted by a flood plain.
...Butchering later, of course, is hard work.
The artist's palette is constantly changing;
He has to learn to use pencil well.
He has to learn to paint again.
It's a long way to having Chinese fur clothes,
Yet there are soaps, dishes, etc.
And of late, with the season ending,
And with the war over, there are sobs
And with us who have only heard of China,
How caring and caring parents think their children
Are.


A TRAVELLER'S SONG

There are sobb and a chord,
As if the wave of the moon could be at peace.
The boatmen are smiling, the villagers laughing.
...shouts of change are made in the wind,
When the historic mountain
Shines against the sunrise in Pool Road.
And memorial candles are wreathed in the late blooms,
Wreathing
The Mountain of Long Life, Wind and Water.
...Oh, when will all the world know
 that never a guest has suitcase-full
And hat and cloak and no bed?
...Night in the mansions dawns with the rustling of pines;
Loud voices are settled by a single shellac,
That, for all its valuables, Pool Road is no where near habitable;
And here at the northern palace a mournful crow sounds the closing bell,
"Joining the House of Long Life."
...The familiar script of Wang Xizhi
Begins Again.
Our Heavenly Mother
Begins Again.

And the quiet has cooled and the city darkens,
A dewy old street vendor calls me by my surname.
He is from Pang, and came from a good family to this city
And he will surely be with you for many years to come.
Be gentle and respectful, he calls me. Call him anything but BYOB.
...From the poisonous damps of the river all the way to the southern palace,
Your harsh words will only serve to stain my white sleeve.
...I will turn back home, I will say no more,
I will drive my car out of the sky, I will burst into a river of tears.
But I will Watch the Indigo Sea from my window
And will Save the Day for the people who have never heard of it.
It is Duty to Do What isier Job No Limestone Column An unassuming youth, small as a deer,
Dreams of green fields and yellow rivers,
Buried by the endless fields of Yan in State!



A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

Along the wall of the Capital a white-headed crow
Flies to the Gate of Green Jade,
Leaves its body in the Yellow Spring,
And, alone on the Tablet of Ye,
Quantitative of its weight on the screen,
The Image of Confucius
is moved by its own Clear Will and Will of Confidence
There that eveningably bows its massive head
And urges its bright red beak,
As it dreams of a Yellow Mountain o'er the Nile.
...In a sudden and final judgment, the Fifth-Generation Deceiver
Must exile again to a Third-World Country
Who, through his will, will be burnt with fire.
...Confucians burnt the tree of life by their lustre;
But natural men can only hasten their rivers and lakes;
And all else is wane as soon as their dams are built.
...Ioke, as I shouldue in your brook,
The candle-loft opened in the palace of Zhou,
And the open gate was closed to me by a passion I did not know was there,
The limpid river water step by step muffle
And small poppies abound on the thin crust of my bread.
...I shall close the brothels of my homeward travels
And await news from home on the ferry back.


BORDER-SONGS I

Cut the grass of Gao and ride on the horseback to my rendezvous
With the dates baked in the palm of the vine.
By this what-goes-against-me boundary, as through all the grasses
And deep in the both of them a bird orders
A LADY FOR GUILT

On the third day of the Third-month in the freshening weather
Many a bell and flute are being played,
As I adored the North Star by the fisherman's returning sail
And Webby would not turn to us alone
If he and his boat could raft ten thousand men a day
And come back with the hardship of battle!
...Destiny is a boat on the waves,
Borne to and fro, beyond our will.


ON HEARING DONG PLAY THE FLAGEOLET
A POEM TO PALACE-ATTENDANT FANG

When the phoenix theme sung by the audience at the fifth-watch bell
Gave its solemn following last night in the Palace of Flowers,
These Gadgets will stir the world again next month when they outshine screens on Mad Men,
And multitudes flock to watch the Wall of Stone.
...First Lady Han has a flower in her door by the golden fountain,
And Later General Li would go to Liaoxi villages alone to hunt phoenixes
And unicorn-ees at his his ladies' mountain.
...Can you guess why I sail, poor chap,
Through the rainy season with no water to drink?
I came to know the City of Silk by the two hills that it is,
And I know well enough not to eat nor drink.
...In the years of Kaiyuan I was Han,
I had a passing talent for music, for the strings to the Canes.
When the harp was about 7 o'clock in the evening,
The Emperor sang: 'I see a white cloud emerging from the desert,
Alive birds growing dim,
The water is fading, the stars red,
Autumn-leaves dripping down.'
...When the Emperor visited the Temple of the Bright Sun,
The Emperor dyed his robes in purple and gold;
He waxed golden and white and stitched his eyebrows;
He finished the Roboute Guile wearers

In the comfort of your single seat, close by a gala dance
Joins you to the music of your drumsticks.
You sing a song of Lu Mountain,
A song that is born of the sun's rise.
...Along the wall of the Colosseum you see ancient temples
With their shadowy crescent-fires heightening the darkness.
A long line of horses and carts turns and the road becomes a footlong
Line by line the bones of ancient monuments have been laid bare
...Mountains are rugged enough without the human heart;
But they are rugged enough without a human will?



A MESSAGE FROM my high-paying official to you
IN COURT

Now that the sun has set beyond the western mountains
How shall we greet one who is courteous toward us
And never urges us any way but the scent of mountain bamboos?
Your case before the Court of Appeals
Was that of a poor old man, seeking employment,
Or a rich merchant from Jueying, in an idle hour?



Your case before the Court of Appeals
Was this a good man, seeking employment,
Or a poor merchant from Huai?
Your case before the Court of Appeals
Moved this Court-giver three thousand miles without a paddle,
And shown him his thirty-eight ships, with their dragon-cloud windows,
Still he tries to enter the dock at Five Peaks.


Your petition before the Court of Appeals
Was this a poor man, seeking employment,
Or a poor man, in the southern leagues,
The helpless victim of a famine,
Bred in the dust by a forgotten lane,
Lifting mats by the red-capped Peak of Blue Spring,
I tuned the music to a drumbeat of weeping when I was found
In the narrow passageway by the Stone City.


Your ten miles of iron rope have to be carried ten thousand miles --
Flowers, are near enough! -- to reach the city of Shu --
And, before you approach the year 4,000,
There are people from Wu and Tong standing here by --
Which is to say, far, far away.


Your petition to the High Road-ie
Prepares me to cross the autumn blood moon --
But I cannot turn back.
The snow has hardened its Peaks and ripples are like a river of water,
With linger-horses in the dark!


My petition to the Yellow Pine
Is written in Chinese-Dong and can be read in Chinese;
But it fails to note the deep meaning attached
To words meant to convey emotion.
My petition should serve as a codeword
To sadness and anguish, as a symbol of company.
I am the eloquent and often-obedient one,
I standing before you, divided into two wings.



A CICADA

Pure of heart and therefore hungry,
All night long you have sung in vain --
Oh, this final broken indrawn breath
Among the green indifferent trees!
Yes, I have again stolen a cup of wine!
Why not remain here and eat here,
As the High Road-granted of song and dance?



WIND AND RAIN

I linger beyond the city-wall, looking for you,
Yet no one to cheer me back home.
Me where you called from a long line of nobles,
Yet no one meets you at the stationhouse.
I am the follower of a learned friend,
Yet werine and werine and we watch each other's backs.
We watch the other nights that our souls go to the west.



THOUGHTS IN THE COLD

You were high, brave as aphaetes,
And you wandered a straight path.
Now, wandering the same way again,
You ask no mind the cold tone of road-ranges.
The same feelings you had before Beirut,
Now you go your way down a descending slope.
...How low were they, going at dawn?
Just when you thought you could reach the north?
Just when you thought you could go that way?
...After buying with your sisters time- tators Terrace and Xiangyang
And seconding your good fortune,
Have you not thought of growing up like Terrace and Xiangyang ?
The very town in which you had so long been banished
Is remembering Liao as its artist.



YOUNGER

Though a child of a great great lady,
You are not your real self.
In fact, you are a shell of your former self.
In a land of conditional prosperity,
And of few com homes, unattainable forests,
Ling is raising good children.

Sunshine has been ours all along the path;
But a moment's thought will
======================================== SAMPLE 54 ========================================
That was cold in the dusk,
And the watcher high against the sky --
But after this long rain, here are the flowers!

And far into India an oriole.



TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. Looking at the moon, I express my thoughts in this poem, which I send to my eldest brother at Fuliang, my seventh brother at Yuqian, My fifteen brother at Wujiang and my younger brothers and sisters at Fuli and Xiagui.

My heritage lost through disorder and famine,
My brothers and sisters flung eastward and westward,
My fields and gardens wrecked by the war,
My own flesh and blood become scum of the street,
I moan to my shadow like a lone-wandering wildgoose,
I am torn from my root like a water-plant in autumn:
I gaze at the moon, and my tears run down
For hearts, in five places, all sick with one wish.



THE INLAID HARP

I wonder why my inlaid harp has fifty strings,
Each with its flower-like fret an interval of youth.
...The sage Chuangzi is day-dreaming, bewitched by butterflies,
The spring-heart of Emperor Wang is swaying in her furlough,
Mermen weep their pearly tears down a moon-green sea,
Blue fields are breathing their jade to the sun....
And a moment that ought to have lasted for ever
Has come and gone before I knew.


The stars of last night and the wind of last night
Are west of the Painted Chamber and east of Cinnamon Hall.
...Though I have for my body no wings like those of the bright- coloured phoenix,
Yet I feel the harmonious heart-beat of the Sacred Unicorn.
Across the spring-grass, while the notes of RAIN BELL are moving
And the barking of WHEEL TOWER after HYDRAIUS,
I should like to take my painted stick and set sail for the moon
But, alas, I dare not think of this adventure.



THE PALACE OF THE SUI EMPEROR

His Palace of Purple Spring has been taken by mist and cloud,
As he would have taken all Yangzhou to be his private domain
But for the seal of imperial jade being seized by the first Tang Emperor,
He would have bounded with his silken sails the limits of the world.
Fire-flies are gone now, have left the weathered grasses,
But still among the weeping-willows crows perch at twilight.
....Master, if he meets, can sight see even the Dragon Lake
And not the Pavilion of the Lake of the Moon
That is to say, all the nine Holy Mountains
That are closed to the human eye?


A NIGHT-VIGIL IN THE LEFT COURT OF THE PALACE

Stories of flying dragons and clouds make the palace green
And a lady, at a distance, cowering, fears the appearance of her face.
On the turn of the Ling Xing, for example,
Or the Yue Yang of martial distinction,
His armour, his sword its pared form,
His coat his colouring heft, his lantern his tink.
But because of his colouring, because of his armour
His armour-trousers were his habit,
His vexatious face mocked at twilight
He would mount trees followed his chariot,
And leave the nearby Mountains of Gold behind him.
His armour was of iron and steel, his armour-tasmancy his tablet;
But now he has a new face, a new hair, his hair is porcelain.
He is less at ease with armour and more at ease with gold.
So pity the poor wretch who has to travel miles to buy it.



FLATINUM IN THE LEFT COURT OF THE PALACE

Flatinum was rising, slowly as a white feather,
But suddenly it faded and thinned like a rain-cloud,
And all others ceased to matter.
...The palace-maid began to fade, too, as white hairs
And lanterns went limp at night.
Her smooth hair is frost white now, but it is growing again
In a little pot over her head, cooled by a touch of rain.
Her thin brow is warm with boiling rain,
And a brow of pure Jade that begins to drip on the river
Is turningly knit a little closer to her heart.
...Though a course of
======================================== SAMPLE 55 ========================================
This sentence has had many a sentence of awkward addition:
When one degree of cloud lingers beyond the eye of man,
How can one drink, how can one breathe?
...At last I can send my messengers northward.
With only the hair on my head escaping from my vacant head,
I can hunt, with my sickly nose, for those who are loved.
There are only bitter herbs to vex me;
And lonely in the dusk I brood on the memory
Of animals and people who have passed my wayward path.



TO ONE UNNAMED V

You were very young when you were chosen.
Once, when you wore shining clothes,
But changed your voice and vomited all your food,
You said to your father, "Daddy, am I dreaming or dreaming- ?
I dream that your eyebrows are crossed,
That your beautiful hairpins you braids in half
And then you brush it again, like a girl enchanted
With icing and a sun of her robe's shew;
And then, raising you this time, by her glance,
And wishing you good luck in your journey,
Off from this village, from this river,
Stirring with your roses, you weave in and out
And turn and flower outstrip one another,
Like a blossoming of wildgeese in spring.


IN THE CAMP OF THE SKETCHING BRUSH

Monkeys and birds are still alert for your orders
And winds and clouds eager to shield your fortress.
...If you are not careful, these tigers and fowl sit still
For days on end, watching the great rush of wind and rain.
...Your envoy, using different writing mediums,
Plucks from various forests branches
And piles them face down on the camp-ground,
In a dreary array of sun and moon,
With his eyes toward east and his brush thick with snow.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

A white-lined cougar steers south-easton its lazy mast
In a straight line north of Yanran river.
When I drew near it glowed from its fragrant shell,
And told its rosy cloud dusk....
But then, north of the border, in its golden cast-iron palace
There came a quietness about its confinement,
That I knew was safe under mask and cloak,
That every hour was spent respecting it;
And, for being southern in age,
More beautiful than the moon or the mountain,
We both were sordid, drinking wine together.



ON A BORDER-FORTRESS

How blue the sandy river was
When your envoy, with no childhood experience,
Deserted a berm along the shore
And bounded it among the villages.
...His first move of the spring carried him to a district of barbarians.
...War-torches invade the barbarian chain
And wheat-seeds are strewn all across the desert.
But envoy Lum Jiu homeward found a district
And the barbarian front line was routed,
And the town of Chu was the harp of the world.
Emperor Xuan, refusing orders,
Stood aside from the war,
His superior to the town's rulers.
And a new beauty than at any time since the old order
Bequeathed to him by her beauty-seekrs a bamboozled youth.
So sweet was his attention to detail
That every bone of bone was measured in thousands....
But, before he swept the desert away,
Here in Lum Jiu his name was a memory.



THE INLAID HARP

I wonder why the inlaid hilt has become the most precious piece of silver,
While mannequins have idlesakes
And servants wait in the dark
For anyone to take them down.
...The reed-bears of the fishermen tell their tales,
While the uplandside legends fade in the night.
Moonlight is the eye of the vie State,
While the human heart is on the instrument of song.
...Where is the silk-worms lined by the threescore?
The inlaid in green the harp;
The inlaid in silver the harp;
Now that the stars are up in the eastern sky,
What does it matter that the brilliant Sun
Plucks wistful the midnight clouds?



THE WALL OF AN INLAID HARP

I am the man with the guitar; I am the song-choir.
I am the one playing the clarinet.
...Cui Hao, my guitar-playing friend,
Must have wielded it through the wild nights
Of summers spent in the deep sky.
For I am friends with the song
======================================== SAMPLE 56 ========================================
A misty rain comes with heavy snowfalls.
The Dragon's Gold Palace is cowed in the bud;
The Jade and Gold of the Roads your Liaisons inspect
Each day the scale of the chaos that is out on the world.
Each year from now on, strictly forbidden animals
Can go free, elation be damned in a thousand rivers and lakes.
...How gladly will we pay for your sake?



SONG OF AN OLD GENERAL

When he was a youth of fifteen or twenty,
He chased a wild horse, he caught him and rode him,
He shot the white-browed mountain tiger,
He defied the yellow-bristled Horseman of Ye.
Fighting single- handed for a thousand miles,
With his naked dagger he could hold a multitude.
...Han Gan, your friend, is dead.
His life should be of a string of jade lamp-trees;
But his is a void in a vast desert.
He was the foreordain of the reign of the Han.
So ingrained in the scriptural fabric
That his voice is heard more than any other fisherman in the world,
That his poetry is lavishly copied by all the generations he has lived.
...The Genie, the Emissary, are gone.
Returning, a year later, from a long journey
They had left earth-stones on both of them, to be found
In an ancient chamber deep in the dusk.
The Genie, echoing in the chamber,
Would not leave the earth, never returning it,
Instead prizing his hair and wove his amorous robe
And plunging it on his foes' camels --
"Oh, let a man of spirit entertain his fellows
With song, dance, and furs! Let him share in the festivities!
...Above, below, below, in the ancient chambers,
Till now I drink to my guest a ruddy duck,
I have nothing to eat, nothing to drink,
My heart and my woe is in the being that drink
And prostitute, matron, drudge, and anything else they want
If they caught him in their cold concentrates.


A SONG OF SOBBING BY THE RIVER

I am only an old woodsman, whispering in the wind.
...The river is silent between my longing and my drunkenliness.
I am at a loss to find another river-
As I ponder on the night's greater and greater day.
...The friend I abandoned three years ago
Is now wandering the quiet path by the fishing-town.
He is less than optimistic in his gauge.
He may be a little older, but he stillpires
He constantly comes to see me from his boat.
...SWORTH OF HANYANG

When the tide-tops over this river-rise become a fog
And the wildgoose carp 1 who live along the shore tremble under the weight,
Where is the constant threat of the ever-growing rain?
.....I tug at my sleeve and see the worn-out and worn-out-
Panting and looking at the same worn-out bottle that was
Too late; I am a seafaring young man alone in a deserted island.
...Sleeping-Dragon, Plunging-Horse, are no generals now, they are flying petals.



ON THE BORDER

The barbarian who lived, or knew the name,
Of men who went on to become great statesmen,
Was bringing down from the Palace books
That never a wise and sound ruler came to him....
Civil and military experts, all serving in different branches of government,
And seeking the best among people, sent off from city to city,
Strode forth together, clad in all the most precious weapons,
And marched to the heights of the sword.
They were jade-white bulls, each with its own tail.
And each with its coin a sword- bird, a cythe drawn by the scythe,
Gathering like mist on the river and on the mountain.
...Do you imperial commissioners
Mean to be less kind than bandits?
The people you force to pay the poll
Are like creatures frying over a fire.
And how can you sacrifice human lives,
Just to be known as able collectors?
...TAKING LEAVE OF WANG WEI

Slow and reluctant, I have waited
Day after day, till now I must go.
Why should I wait for you any longer?
For today I will take my wine, for tomorrow I will take my cup.
Wait till you recommence dinner, I beg you.
Thought of needing a name, I just made my vow.
I will Come Willing now of my own will!



Willfulness
======================================== SAMPLE 57 ========================================
How ashamed I am to be idler than you statesmen
And still to be your friend.
...Let me sing you a song of thanksgiveness.


Song of the Tartars

Back in the day, when people called me the land of sow-hearsse and the mountains of spring-leaves,
I revelled my left hand in the style of an Imperial Enforcer.
A herd of white deer chieftains leapt from the desert toward their fellows;
A Chinese gourd was force-fed to its loads in two swift wheels
And a Chinese fisherman was chilled out in the middle of the river
And his tapes were ruffed up with greyish storks.
...What a change the water of spring!
Why, then, do people keep coming?
O treacherous Gorges, why do you keep returning empty-handed?



A SONG OF A SOBBING

I am only an old man, whispering a sob,
As I steal like a drunk-boy, into a hungry-town.
Oh, how can I bear to sweep the floor of my old friend's
Sea-Gull City? Why beware of the chill of sunset,
Of wandering eyes wandering shut from my desolate wall.
...Under the yellow sky-pegayed towers
There are only darkness-wakes for horses and men;
And now and then-ê�a seem to be walking slow --
They are singing, of course, to the China Sea Monkey.


LOOKING TOWARD AN INN

ITALY A SIGH IN THE AUTUMN

By the looks on the girl's face, JUN THE WILD
 IS DEAD AT THE BOWL.
- Where is Lady Jue? HOWEVER DUINA
IS LISTENING TO HIM

 LOTTERY MEETING WITH JUN THE YANGXI

Cock-crow, the autumn sea,
The insane loose in the east end....
Meeting again in maid-servant of the eminent lord
Would it be easier than going back home? He would send it quickly,
With a single gong.
TAKING LEAVE OF WANG WEI

How wrong had I learned the hard way
That hat and robe I took away of myself
Were of the highest decoration.
Cock-crow, how wrong have I met you!
TAKING LEAVE OF WANG WEI

Where are you going, wild man?
Why haven't you come a while yet?
JINGE IN THEARD ROADS

You have a great many things to offer the world,
Take with you as much as you will need
When you go back to your villa that formerly held you;
And this I remember doing away with my great
High School Years and returning to this river village.
...You also disappeared with your student, Jun,
7th October, 1957, to attend the Imperial Wedding
Of Celestial Twin Wings; ten thousand miles away.
Your vanished student had gone, at the age of fifteen,
To the Golden Palace Inning-Pot; the first lady had died,
Her honoured student taken captive
In an ancient temple in Changan.
...When you went away, the chamber was incapacitated,
Your spirit, at risk, returns.
Oh, let a man of spirit study life!
Let him drink alone! let him hunt,
As he did when you were both so inexperienced
That ten years ago your young pupil Byronus Disappointed You.
Let him stretch his hand toward your empty shell
And stroke it with his left hand as if it were a sword.
Heart's fragrance is spent with the closing moments
Of the stars tottering through the sky.
...Move your great paw along the edge of the parchment
And print on the inset a familiar name --
A breeze is dragging the long row of rivers
Which tear at your central lamp.
Poets, in the years of King Chang,
Have carried the limpid ink
All across China, to the nearest town.
...Oh, at last we may descend to the mountains!
Our cause is victorious, our wars short!
Our flags gleam, our banners shine,
With sounds of autumn over the marsh
And the river waves under our bridge.
...Entering the mountains, we eat, we crowd around our camp-
Tilloner couriers toss us a bone
And forgotten welk through the fields
Are faded into thin dust in the evening sun.
...We pardon each other high-pitched squeaks,
We shake our hands affectionately, we shake our heads --
But we heartily thank heaven for this far-reaching gift
And we wish that it were as simple and simple as
The balancing of two deities." --Poets

TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. Looking at the moon, I express my thoughts in this poem, which I send to my eldest brother at Fuliang, my seventh brother at Yuqian, My fifteen brother at Wujiang and my younger brothers and sisters at Fulhou.

My heritage lost through disorder and famine,
My brothers and sisters flung eastward and westward,
My fields and gardens wrecked by the war,
My own flesh and blood become scum of the street,
I moan to my shadow like a lone-wandering wildgoose,
I am torn from my root like a water-plant in autumn:
I gaze at the moon, and my tears run down
For hearts, in five places, all sick with one wish.



THE LEYOU TOMBS

With daylight short among three mountains,
I am passing in my little boat the Leyou Tombs,
Lingering for daylight between water and sand.
Heaven and earth are moving now03 and planes and winds bringing
The moon and the windless sky, under my foot.
A long path of flowers lies between us,
And the river is coming our boat.
...I am passing, behind a Hill Giant,
No company more, but shadows of a river running.
...At midnight I hear a bell cocks and an insect cowering in the grass,
An ancient sound resembling an insect being wakened.
The ground is wet with the whimper of the pet bird,
And the whimper of the unheard, harmonizing with my ears.
...At dawn, coming down from the mountains,
I hear a long cold wind in the street,
A cold wind in the fields, a brook amid the grasses.
...I have a message from my home in Kuanzhang,
Which I will open and close, showing you what is happened there,
And I will summon you at dawn from my mountain-town --
"Come, help me through" (A POEM ON THE PEAK)

When she tells you that her husband, a temple-builder,
Flies, fearing for his life, to the west of the river,
And cannot breath again until he has home-made him a chariot,
Willie then rich enough to buy a car,
Flies then to turn homeward- wayfarers-in-waiting.



A MESSAGE FROM LAKE DONGTIN
TO PREMIER ZHANG

Here in the Eighth-month the waters of the lake
Are of a single air with heaven,
And a mist from the Yun and Meng valleys
Has been blowing eastward for three days.
...After a long day of playing, nothing goes for my comrade
Now that he has moored in the palace of the Prince of Peace.
He who has no guts to face the end, who can stomach the hump,
Wolves in three rivers, are people who never move far from home.
They stop at a important pass and ask of a lord
Who will take them to a court-outplace of southfaring,
Where wine is served and food is served;
And where the high mountain to the south of us
Is guarded with trails of trumpets and phoenixes,
And children of the founders of Jiangshi are waiting
For them in the dust of the desert to a stretch of elgin and fur.



A MESSAGE TO HAN CHO THE YANGZHOU OF THE ASCENDED ARMY

The year is 2016. The heavens are opened and the moon goes down;
A rain causes flexing of the horses on soggy horses;
A man of the Third Column leaps from the stairs,
His wet hair whitens and dries as he descends,
His wet cloak fluttered by a rain of flowers;
A dragon's white face awakes and grieves old age;
The Holy Ghost comforts thepa and shrugs the dew;
The General Ananus Jayahees the Holy Ghost blesses
And these are the fruits of his soul:
"Tonight in the ladder of his white cloak he lies,
Behind him, during the night,
How many thousands are requesting him.
...Rain has broken the silk curtains and the soft light has dulled;
The dew on his brows is worse than the blue
======================================== SAMPLE 59 ========================================
And slowly we drive back to the capital
Where children, growing up to be knights in gold,
Watch from the roofs of the imperial villa.



ON THE TERRACE OF ASSEMBLED ARMY

Petals of autumn are falling like a girl sandsea
And wind and water are pouring through the
Blue Wall of Hundred-Ninth-September.
...The Eighth-month long snow of the Bosphorus
Is gleaming through the imperial window.
Blue birds are not yet at their peak yet --
Even a slender porcupine cannot prey like a thousand
Wolves.


TS

The Imperialist siege at Ch'u-T'ang
Where green cuckoos are flying homeward over the banks of Lake Nan Yu,
And yellow caviar is a white in the sea,
I hear Chinese fishermen on jutting out from the North Mountain
Beating those old drums down to the snow.


TS

The Jade Pass is raging like a river
And battle-drums have sounded for days --
With sound like silkworms decaying.
...The sharp gale that rises from the Yellow Spring passes
 through three thousand mesas, breaking the crystal of the jade;
Clouds of rain echo across the upper mountains,
And birds are flying home to frost-willow.



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And mandarin-ducks die side by side.
With human toll-beats and swallow-falls,
Turning left, we begin our journey
As slowly as earth moves two thousand miles.
...At the northern border a band of ferocious horses
Willow-hogs and red-headed Parsippans await them.
And then, casting a spell,
First, a dream come true for my lakka
And, second, a taste of heaven invited me home.
...The Tripod of General Hanley
has opened a thousand miles' road
And hundreds of miles of road-ranges lies before my eyes --
So I see the white line of the Yukon through the fullness of time.
And so I sing, I am heard telling the lies,
I am driven to the cave of the red-headed General --
How sorry I am to see my friend gone.



A SONG OF A TEMPLE OF GUILDOM III

The Jade Pass is warm with spring,
And the court of a sovereignis the setting-flame of a candle.
Guests, coming from all quarters,
Come to think of returning, Guided Adventurers!
...There is a girl, withdrawn and moody,
Who has to be pushed to the ground ten steps.
She has to go door-to-door to get what she asks.
...While rain and sleet obscure the sun, clouds brighten the bright moon.
And single mothers bring their young with them,
And lonely sisters breast-feed themselves
While the charm of the Holy Ghost livesthe battery of a song.



A FAREWELL TO GOVERNOR LIU
ON HIS WAY TO YANGZHOU

You were quick to fall asleep in the three Ba Roads --
And warm breezes prevailed at the Jiang Towngate.
On your way to gonowlo, I ask you where you are going and
How kind and kinderer you are.
And slowly I am drifting
With a breeze of silken hair and a sea of blueberries.
...Tomorrow you go to the Yellow Gate,
Over the top of Jiang, to be pardoned.


ON MEETING YOU-SAY

I am glad to be meeting you-no matter where in the world
Your fame has grown, like the Western and South Powers,
And my voice has been hushed
By your halting tone of voice.
...After a while I am afraid to say a word.
I have learned to watch for hostile words.


MEETING YOU-IN-NATHOM

A Light in a Lamecn is hard to beat,
Yet no fame like that of the moon,
So you ask me where I am going and I say,
In Hua Hin.


ON MEETING HUZHOU

I find you far away, lost in thought.
How beautiful our houses are-how wide the gardens-
My tears are running cold in my little boat.
What are you thinking of, old friend?
The moon is in the window and my tears are dripping.
What are you thinking of, wang tributary crab-town?


HI, UNNAMED I

You have come to Nameless Isle
To spend the night with those who are forgotten,
Half-hearted
======================================== SAMPLE 60 ========================================
you Are the Light of the World
My lamp shines upon the empty mountain
You are the Light of the World
On your lonely porch you will dwell
Or you may rest.



POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

Forlorn in the River-Cloud,
When the Autumn Moon lights your sail,
You are at the chess-board alone,
The Great Rainbow GLAD I CAUSE TO SLender
Your lone sails distress, you are swifter still
You see the Yellow Star at my eye!


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME III

Ten thousand sail by the tall bridge,
Three thousands of them banked at the rain-falls
And no human being was on them until three thousand
Stargazers from all corners of the world waited
At the other end of the bank, at a distance of twenty miles.
By the time the three thousand or so people had made it,
The Great Wolf was hovering down from the clouds;
The Tartar chieftain's horse was in the valley, with his bounty of jade birds
And the body of a hero hung from the world:
Time was long before we could send a general;
But far beyond our reach, if sent for, we caught him.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES II

The sky was pallid with sunset and dawn,
And sun and moon parted at the foot of mountains.
A LUTE SONG

China Yang's song is a bell for the dark --
That life can profit only by its cries of the pure,
That China's temples are drunk with the fragrance of spring
Over the spring-sweeping mountain, moon and stars.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME V

Zhou lived in Jingfei Mountain Range,
And pianos sounded throughout the place.
How glad he was to be in this remote village,
How high his boat to the ocean --
How old his white sails to the waves!


ON LEAVING THE TOMB OF PREMIER FANG

Having to travel back now from this far place,
I dismount beside your lonely tomb.
The ground where I stand is wet with my tears;
The sky is dark with broken clouds....
I who played for the rebel troops in the Second World War
Am now Acting President of the United States.


ON LEAVING THE TOMB OF PREMIER FANG

I who played for the Confederate troops in the South and West Philippine Wars
Am returning now to this desolate mountain town.
The sky is broken in the general's path....
And my men leave the battle with little or no concern
And their horses are killed in the skirmish and rain.


PARTING I

Having to go taking my places,
So I dismount beside your tomb.
The ground where I stand is wet with my tears....
I am of less use to this region than General Zhou.
I dismount beside your brother-in-law
And my duty is over; I am a lone wild-goose.
...Sunset adorns the upper levels
And valleys are littered with second and third men.


Parting II

Having to travel back now from this far place,
I dismount beside your lonely tomb.
The ground where I stand are wet with my tears....
I am of less use to this region than General Zhou.
...In his younger days, when he was Emperor,
Western Asia was ruled by an ancient people,
With all its hills and valleys broken up,
And rice and wine are taken from the drunkenards like pears.
...Cultures are extinguished by loud music,
Wolves are scarce missing people,
The buildings of the cities tremble with the sound of wind.
...The mountains and the city-village are brought out of ashes,
The river and the lake tremble with the sound of wind.


THE SONG OF A GUITAR

I was bidding a guest farewell,
When discretion lacked me,
When I gave my best guess,
But who would tell the great General
If he knew what he saw ?
The Dealer is much needed
In the south where the strong cook's brook.
ON LEAVING THE TOMB OF PREMIER FANG

Having to goting again, I had better go running
With my hands like a waterspout.
The city-wall is stony now,
With petals running down my bare shoulder;
I am little while Solitaire and Solitaire II.
As I lovelily rise, my cloudy hair
Stands on both of my hands toward the rain.
...Made of rushes of rivers and lakes,
And of murk along the border in a flash,

======================================== SAMPLE 61 ========================================
ESQUIRE FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL

The statesmen ask of the day when new sovereigns should rule
And we hear that fortune is smiling on Emperor Wu's plan,
Which, among other things, gives you the high pretext
To initiate your own death by tapping a hand of destiny.
...Marsh-General Wang You also developed a genius for imperial conciliation
And, through his secretary Yang Jizun, built a country home
And built a people its own boat and drum;
And, after victory in the Pacific War,
Debts were paid for them, factories were filled
And the way was known to the world --
And you, a Premier, headed for China,
Was ready with his own money to crush the North.
...Hanley monkeys are born from diseased fathers,
Yet no one cares for a sickly Premier.
Therefore, at your bidding, I will crush the King's dream.
Your Premier was born too young
To bear the strain of an illness as profound as yours.
Your failed war effort failed, your famine defeated
Your people hungry, but not loyal.
You bred a son who was formidable enough,
Yet who could master the sword?
...There were moons and years, days and months,
And the effort of holding off an invader
And of building a new and formidable dynasty.
Your formidable general was vanquished, but not by a spear.
Your formidable general was vanquished, but by a shot becoming water.
...The eagle and the unicorn, emboldened,
Flower-broker Tristaniny and follower Yu Xin,
All fledging in the day of bloody slaughter
Strode forth together in the quiet of night.
A Song of Courtyard Flowers
 (HD video, HD here)
Host of the court Wang Jing have you to take on duos all night long.
They were swift, their warriors swift,
With bows and arrows as sharp as horses fire.
They had General Zhou in his gold hide and a his horse,
And the captured tigers and the deranged tigers
Were waiting for them, offering blood to drink.
...Hanley pangkok sways and shiversform its drums
As it hovers there between slow motion warbles --
At a ten to one risk of death;
But a man like Zhou, who had the blood of his pet mare,
Strode forth from the court, his horse neighing.
...The palace-girls-in-waiting
Were chanting, "Guo yun, Guo yun,
Who is Guo yun?"



THE HANLEY PEAK

A sweet spring-flood is on the road
And the dew from windows in the house
Is running across the city-lands tonight.
...On Qutang Road all the while you are away
The late spring wildgeese have no wind,
They are flying trickling raindrops down
As far as the eye can see.
...Near the palace-gate a phoenix-man


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME
ON THE CHU RIVER

A cold light shines on the moth- eyebrows
And a wind drinks the evening air
As if by magic a massive wildgoose were flying.
...At the height of spring all the mountain-peaks are lost,
Lingering westward in a misty twilight,
These scarlet clouds are saying unutterable things.
...The River of Yellow Flowers is trembling with spring....
And men of old days and men of new days
Are altering the way they talk;
The wise elder sits listening, the youth less so.
...And China has changed beyond recognition
To whatever country you have moved,
With your two by two by the river.


ON THE YANGZHOU WEAPON

Since Yangzhou experienced the lash of war in the spring
And the war- torn city has gone through no rains,
Since not one cloud has fallen on the capital yet,
I who have lived in Ju Tower before the Yangzaris left,
See how little love is ever shared by the two nations involved.
...Cold sweat comes to my brows now with the battle- torn city
And rain on a morning of revolution.
...The first Tang waves in the heart of Hen were met with silence.
...Seconds are spent in a world of disorder
And the sorrow of a thousand nights goes away....
Eunuchs leave the palace washed and dressed;
Mergers and acquisitions are slow --
And year after year there are new Imperial Houses....
In the twelfth-month the City of Silk is awash with silk;
In the fifties a Chamber-Gatherer dies,
He was the foreman of this entrepotable work
======================================== SAMPLE 62 ========================================
RECONFIDENTIAL

I have a message from your southward voyage:
It was the happiest hour of the whole year.
You have such a great and humble mind,
That he never sends you returns,
Doubtful of chapter and verse.
...I ought to be glad to hear it, when I awake this morning.



A NOTE LEFT FOR AN ABSENT ECLUSE

When I questioned your pupil, under a pine-tree,
"My teacher," he answered, " went for herbs,
But toward which corner of the mountain,
How can I tell, through all these clouds ?"


ON SEEING WANG LEAVE FOR THE SOUTH

My SEASONS HAVE ENDED IN A MESSAGE TO CUI

Have I not told you a truant's true sorrow?
Measure my hair well, my tears well,
And try not to weep:
For I watch you from a vanished sky....


At sunset I lie down to sleep in the straw
And dreams of a vanished world.


TIANMU MOUNTAIN

It's a wonder so little is known
About the mountain range so far from the heart.
That man, who lived long ago,
Made a very great city a mountain;
And the woman who washed his hands on his tomb
And lived in order to mark his life,
Hears thieves steal from his neighbouries
And complain that they never land you.
...Little by little I watch a man in the evening rain
Who seems to be in good health,
Waiting for the spring wind to pass his door.


MOUNTAIN-RIVER CHENGGGANGS

This is the way it always is with the mountain of cloud.
On the mountain there are few people --
And now they are coming to see me,
How beautiful I am to them all the way.
...Sunset is the limit of their white sails.
I am turning south, into the western mountains --
And they are coming back another day.



TIANU RIVER

Away from home, away from my parents,
Now live in the sunset beside the River of Stars.
...Night in the rocks blows me away
And makes me sick to think of you,
Your moonlight is like a flower in a bough of wheat;
And none of my neighbours knows anything about me.
...Oh, if ever there was a need for acquaintance
I have already made an end of these black marks!



A NUNTING

Oh, at last you are coming back now!
I was lonely and late and unhappy --
And now on the banks of the river
Of colourful plum-trees and of sweet chrysanthemums!
...Round about the pulpit you have been ordered
To hear the priest's plea for intercession....
I hear him in the quiet of his golden car,
He seems to be arriving at the temple.


NOTES

Bard of hearing
Is almost always with his fingers on his diadem a note
And brings with him books praising the Confuciary.
...The sage Wenksang is haggling
For the life of his Confessor, he has been deprived of his mind....
Last year he petitioned the stake for his life,
But his wish was denied, he was crucified instead.
...Conquerors dream of awe of the Stone Temple,
Of dragons and demons the Stone God is worshipped.
Here on the southern mountain, year after year,
Earth and water are shaken with evil odours....
But the King of Yinzeyang isqueath his students
Through lordly browsways and deep in the Mountains
THINKING IN THE PALACE OF LAKE DONG

Of a Princess, crying in the lamp,
And a Knight of the Golden Tortoise lifting from the sea-
War-torches float along the river's shore.
...Invaders from the Tower of Jade gather
In the Sundering to invade the world.
They wear armour of mail cut from jade,
And unicorns sway ten thousand mountainside.
...Here in the Palace of the King, beauty is of the essence
And the wearing--of-garments-are taken like gifts.
The coarse clothes of the stud princes slip away
When one is afoot a monarchs:
"My bones and my lamp are ill used,
And I am soperous that I forget the rain.
...The King of Wei hunts unicorns
In the Three Gorges of Green Willow.

Deserted mansions, courtyarded with pink-agate and gold-plating, lie scattered in the world between two Heaven-faced mountains.
And the King of Yan hears about those who have no honour:
They see a cloud of kill-cloud rise from the water's utterly hidden mountain source.
And he urges those who are lowly to greatness to seek fame in the three Dynasties --
That intensity of feeling which lowers one's heart to a crawl,

Through the grim door of the Dou Tower Secrets of the Dou have I wakened;

Came pouring down from the Mountain of Heaven.



WAYSON TO PHOENIX

With weeds in the knee-high maple-trees of home,
With a wildgeese in the bell-town RIVER
I am leaving this world; I am parting with the stars.
I am leaving my brothers. I am leaving my soul.
I am a lone sky-hound from the hills.
I am a lone-wolf from the matins.
... Conversing friends are hard work,
The mountain haze has left my pair of wanderingshirts.
It takes years of crossing a thing like a river
To be at the foot of a large peak.
... Mae West is coming home. Her husband, a Knight of the Golden Tortoise,
Is in Town for the spring-training.
Why not Come along then, star of them all,
Take my place in the ladies-circle of the ladies-glory?


A PALACE POEM

Where is the music of the palace trumpet? --
For that is where my heart's sake,
After my late Emperor's death.
... The bridegroom, fond of her court,
Attacks the vendor's horse,
His sweet voice drowned in the palace's ices.


BIDDING A POEM

Now that the heat of the sun has left her blithely
In the weeds of Qinghai she asks how she can adorn herself
With the breezes of autumn with her evening flower.
... The sweet sound of her song is cut off
At an hour when she has little time with the Palace Spy.


BIDDING   A POEM

Now that the war-wind has entered a sandy-plum and
Over the green maou the green sky is gone.
Dare she say, I have just received your silk,
As I have waited for you here in the greatboat.

The strong od breath has whipped the thin silk;
And the moon has reflected our colours
On a silk-screen with a silken line of flowers.
Oh, how can I bear to burden you everything?
You are alive and well, fully burdened,
You leave the immoderate world behind you.
...I will tether my boat to a river leder
And ride to you when you come along the wall.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

Forlorn in the northeast among wind and dust,
Drifting in a world of clouds and ice,
We read in the northeast ages of ages of ages!
War-torches invade the barbarian home
And wildgeese endlessly beg on the banks of Lake Dongting.
...Exiles from China are arriving at the border.
We remember those days of the Yangdo --
Twenty years among the mountains,
Twenty years of sunshine and fog,
Twenty years of sunshine and shadow,
Of which we know nothing.

In three thousand miles of floating land --
Three thousand miles of floating land!

A MESSAGE TO HAN CHO MY FRIEND GEBE

In our northern chambers we hold pureseless still,
We are both passing through Shu....
When shall we lift our cups again and be free again?
The long road ahead might seem like a long one;
But it is only a long way, and nowhere near enough.
...To be Director of Thee Camp in the year of our parting
And to serve in a high post in the world divided
Is a journey of the single love, of two lives.
...Not even the quietest of tears
Along the bank of the Xuan River.


TO VICE-PREFECTS LI AND HAN CHO

They ask me where I have been on my journey;
I say: "To Hua Fellows in the City of the Red Phoenix!"
When great teachers are brought to a simple question
Doubt not that some will see beyond hearing....
Seventy-two years have passed us both like clouds,
With the moon above our boat and the wind below.
We hold one another's hands and laugh.
...We but watch the moonlight from a farm behind my,
And the breeze from a bough of wheat.


IN THE AUTUMN NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
Watching it alone from the window of her chamber-
For our matriarchs she is bringing to her dynasty a card of barley;
For emperor before her she has stripped.
...It is very late in the year, so she brings the barley-kale with her.
So she will close her window when the moon is warm,
And her pale fingers caress a gold ruler's willow-trees --
"We Are the Red Phoenix, our Lady of the Lake. Will you please place her on our king's coronet?
The sandalwood-leaves are tinged with a river of her chosen flowers;
The crystal of Heng Mountain is a deep red with dragon-tip
Flags have been blown up and destroyed here and there;
The long road to Heng Mountain lies both way and foot- way.


TAKING LEAVE OF WANG WEI

I face to face with kin and friends of the Xie Wolves I
My path leads me through yellow fog and rain,
With the waterfall's peak just before my eyes.
...Angels gone are a hundred signs gone.
Cicadas make chirping in the morning sun.
I am thinking of Jia Yi, my fiancée.
...Night in the court of China's greatest Emperor
Is raining chicken-dogs, power-brokers, and, of old days, there have been
And now is not enough love on the throne to end the misery.


GRASSES

Turning now to Yan XI for introductions,
I find him lying on his tom- hide in a sling,
His legs wound wide open for a foreign weapon.
The sun is sinking deeper in the flooded southern river
And birds are mute today in the mists of space.
...But now the Fifth-month snow of the Red Toad has closed
And the cold in the fields grows thick with the blowing of a wind lance,
And I think of you, down in the pit of the earth,
And my voice is choked with bitter grief,
Having to think only of you now.


A SONG OF UNENDING SORROW

A ragtime sings of old Unending Sorry-Shines,
Yet no new crying since.
And people are longing for an end to this long wait,

Opening a can of wine in the cold dawn.
Her mother-in-law is an exiled noble
Who was killed in a great battle.

That I am parting for a lodging-place.

The Fourth Edition is at hand --
And final is the fortune of the few.


DEGRADING MEETING MEI WEST

The evening bell comes calling.
Have you not heard of MEI MEI'S YOUTOWN HOME ?
? Near the quiet river, maple-trees support a tall chair
And the red leaves of a delicate plum.
And low are the open fields, the quiet portico points
While my arriving autumn moonlights a stormy road.
It's sunset, and I drive away to my lodging-place.
Where am I going? home?!


THE TEMPLE OF THE PREMIER OF SHU

I live, I dance; I write.
But science has left me no successor.
My true teacher came from a good family;
Which is why I learn how to dance.

BAKING THE NEW ZEANS TEMPLE

Making the new levees in the sky his sacred ground,
He did not know spring came first-round;
And then he opened his canker-glass and showed me the temple of the famous Premier.
He painted the temple in the morning from grasses and maples
And the river was at its height, when he was with his friends.
Sunset was over the falls, and torrents supported his horses
Like clouds that are eternal, yet float on the sunset.
....Before I knew it, the country about which I had so longed
Was come to an end. I have changed my clothes in the Shops to cover my Deer-Hat.
So I let my hair-boundalice pass me by,
And dozed off in the cool of the autumn sunset.
But what am I waiting for in the streets of Nanjing?

The three rivers merge into one,
With the nightless peak HUNDRED an evening.

On the other end of the fence are vine-trees that will keep you warm --
And, between neo-classical wood and russian iron,
I am taking my wine, I am drinking my wine,
I am fixing my glasses on my lute and, content,
I am floating in the air of spring with a slanting cloud.

And singing my Song of the Wheel of Gold,
Oh, let me be waving my lute too,
As I weep my self-imposed last farewell.

In twelve chambers the ladies' house has been chosen

And tonight in the Palace of Long Life they will be watching.
...From the highest palace in the world they have watched the palace shake
On receiving news from the purple palace-girls' rosy covers.

Pure tears flow faster than colour;
And still to the end of the world the sadness
Is woven of many words.
...In the flame of autumn night descends upon the world
And petals are spilled endlessly.


IN THE CAMP OF THE XIEWon. II

His quarters in this inner chamber are as quiet as his palace;
Yet his splendour, that of two monarchs,
Shines like a dawn on the green mountains of Henan.

228 BESCTHS OF THE WORLD

Time was long for dinner to start,
And vegans and vegetarians started off empty-handed.
On the river between palaces there were made light;
And at the foot of the Palace of Bliss they were met
With a thousand questions about robes and food.
...Long before dawn on the mountain,
Swept there both by the Southern River and the Pass
And disembarked at the port of Sterne,
I legions of a dozen countries and tribes were departing.
...Captain over the barbarian ocean
Willing of heaven's will, to keep me company,
I have just tidied my chamber-knife.
War-drums on the Yangtze,
Easter-march ripples along the border
Where barbarians are camping, who cares?
I would blow up the place of your most sacred
Mount, to hide my face from the sun.


A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

Along the wall of the Capital a white-headed crow
Flies to the Gate where Autumn Enters and screams there in the night,
Then turns again and pecks among the roofs of a tall mansion
Whose lord, a mighty mandarin, has fled before the Tartars,
With his golden whip now broken, his nine war-horses dead
And his own flesh and bone scattered to the winds....
The Imperial Prefect sends for Zhang.
Du Fu can hear the farmers' plaintive plea.
He knows better than to sail.
He loves nature constantly.
Be gentle and respectful, as a rice-terrion merchant
Who is always courteous toward a guest.
...If he sees a chance to flee, he brings his lute to him.



A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

Along the wall of the Capital a white-headed raven
Lords of the place of your demise, brought my envoy's body.
Dead or alive, I await his destination.
Where he is gone, I know his body.
His envoy has been found.
My heart and my dreams have been lost....
For years I have waited for him to reach me.
When he finally does, I bury my head in the sand and weep....
Night after night I have watched the white-toad river bound for Heaven.

Mountain-ranges and ravines are sweeping at night....
And where shall we lie next-brief, centred on this very river?



A SONG OF AN AUTUMN MIDNIGHT


China Dreaming IN ONE GOVERNMENT

Calm was the governor's voice,
And his evening-wine was ready.
But he still chose twilight for a mission.
Here he could plant his plant-his-dirt,
His green grasses no longer his concealment.
Here he could seize his great optical lamp,
And use it not only to see but to hear the music of the night.
Here he could frame his great camera,
And use it not only to record the moment
But also to record the moment's words?


Here in the Eighth-month at the Yellow Crane Terrace,
Our midnight-wind chills our temples;
We murmur a sad word as we do so,
As the hour of year makes twilight come,
And the waters aid in pouring Desolation-Cry.


ON THE EIGHT-SIDED POOL

My heart sank when I headed north from Yan Country
To the camps of China lying in the sunshine,
And the nine-coloured pond.
...The Ballads of Aurora are welcomed,
Lingering down nine rivers and mountains,
The bright moon grows gold in the sky,
The countries and dominions of the rainbow sign:
Here I shall have
A free hand in preparing the cocktails,
And the victory lap has begun.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Light dries on Yang Mountain,
And a soft water- spout flies up from the sea.
Beyond we watch the river rise daily,
And nearer we hear the washing of horses and vermilion paws.
...What are these people like who think for a walk?
...The spring-heart of Emperor Wang is singing no song,
And his Emperor, from heart-to-foot, has slammed the door wide.


TO WANG LEAVE HOME

I leave you sick with a fever of starry cloud,
I leave you in a long-necked girdle
The bitter cold of the mountains away.
I am unable to walk three hundred miles.
...I give my leave now to go home.
BRINGING IN THE OLD TIMES

The changing has left the capital
And London to the Earl of Han.
You were first to move in;
Then Beaufort was built on a fault;
And when a man of genius goes missing,
You called your friend, then sent your men to find him.
...Must human hearts blossom in new years?
Especially when life goes wrong,
How could you love?


A FAREWELL TO HEbeATLU

I am a stranger to him
And someone you can talk to.
...Oh, let me hold my horse and ride him
Like a father who cares for his little child,
And not let your little one down!
The wildgeese never answer me
I am lost in the mountain
Wildgeese come running home.


AFTER MISSING THE RECLUSE ON THE WESTERN MOUNTAIN

To your floating head I longed
That tomorrow I would cross, over the river,
Wildgeese that were trouble-shoot.
...The region is wet with clouds --
And the waters are cold with a fisherman
Over the mix of lakes and rivers that has no name.
Where strange men rush in running water,
Why do people keep coming?

And the world is at peace,

Or you will doubt my anguish.



STAYING AT THE FARQUA LOOKOUT

The highest peak leads to the Hill of Green Jade,
And the thin darkness of the surrounding mountains;
But I have been away from you long enough.
You are still with your bride when she flowers your mat,
And a distant drum and a distant bird.
...Round a turn of the turn of the river, in a setting green heaven,
Her floati depletes my wine;
It is vain to pour it, for it smites my heart....
You are still with your small mirror, gazing at the green sky.
Looking at it illuminates private thoughts,
Confusing even the peacocks.
Looking at it illuminates quiet birds.
...It is not my place here to reprove,
Nor am I responsible for my humble opinion;
But rather a stranger is sent off to prison.


STAYING AT THE LEFT IMPALATER

Under the pines of a floating mountain,
In a vacant temple there heal your wounded temples,
Sacred weapons be reassigned.
In the morning, while we clean the temple,
Flower- girls sing and dice our sacrifices.
In the evening, while we clean the temple,
Flower- boys take our embroidered garments
And our embroidered silk-shirts are given away.
Night before the galleries of the Empire, open to the public,
Forty-eight thousand imperial edicts
Are decreed a solemn war,
The Emperor must pardon his brother.
War-fires are declared over rivers and mountains
And breast-waters plunge to the earth.
The flags of the three Five Imperial Mother Cities come together
Like a chain of lightning fastening a person,
But without a government or a judiciary,
There's no one for the day or the month.
...The name of the Tsar, fugitive, in a state of amnesia,
Debts have to go.
How can effort be made to bring wealth to the poor?
...October is a time of peace in the south,
Monkeys come home, birds are returning.
Oft friends of yours truly poor and menaced,
Go to the Lease School and study ten thousand things.
Remember these red fish you used to eat,
Which no one cares for other than yourselves?
...While the Emperor is gone, drink is banished from the market-place.
Why should I care if my wine is good,
If it spoils? --Just remember --
That ten thousand pounds of wine
Must have made a roll of heaven.


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lying on a sultry high-bush,
She stands on her high throne with bluest eyes,
She has greenly scabbarded the leaves.
Her shadowy temples are veiled with a whitening shadow,
And her naked huge cervix is hidden in a sheen of mystery.
...While human life is bound to suffer change,
Ancient and modern,
And modern and old,
Theologically speaking,
What about humankind?
...And here on this high mountain
Are we to follow the lead of a spirit
And follow the life of achieved beauty?


LOOKING DOWN AT A BUDDHIST POEM

BODhi, sashay thayo,
Who told you that rain is made of seven sowing shoots?
...The path of a buddhist stream is a path of blossoming flowers;
The dreary sky is full of split-parks
As I watch the white sun raised and the red moon shadowed
From the far sky, Lord, glory!
I would stand beside the spring-spirit and weep on her sleeve!
Moved by Ocasio's song, I sang it for him
When he was little, a Buddhist monk in a dingy tower
Who had to watch the wintry world.
His teacher, an earth elemental,
Was born dead young, too, but was reborn in you
As the low-lying hero who stands at the crossroads
And urges the low-hearted to flight.
...Affordable, here in the eastern valley, health-paying,
Kindergarten-ages is a long way from the dusty mountains.
And while the high cost of livingrontfered homesick

On which, instead of the Emperor's seal,
Horseshoes, bulldozed for gardens,
Dancing still for messages, we survey the past
And come upon Friends again from long ago.



ON LEAVE-ON-DAO TO CENSOR

Henceforth I will not farewell
Until a new scent of acceptability beckons.
Grateful for waterfowl that roamed Eastern
Back then, they stopped serving the City-Prince,
And came home from the Mountain-top Ridge and beyond.
...The Forbidden City once reserved a great many as friends;
But the City-Gates now hold the Faith and the Sun is high
I drink to the Hanlanis and Amazons in the morning.



TO LI BAI AT THE SKY SEND

Rivers and lakes are sentry-fires,
In the evening rain they peer frostily out the window.
Fish and birds are lost in the flood of sea- dust . . . . . . . .
I bury my young in the gruelling year
And am gone for days through the mountainside.

I am sad and cold in my heart.
Sad is life after the Palace of Heaven.
Poets who have died at thirty-two
Dream of the Hills of the River Yang and the Mountain of the Dragon.
Sad is life after the Palace of Heaven.
Here by the Yuan Palace on the evening of the mountain
I meet my friend, the very day he dies,
The Yellow Crane watching from his deck.

Slow and careful she has chosen flowers for cups in the warm candle

She is very kind to her daughter,

To men like princes and plebes.


CAWLDS OF THE TAUI

Thinking of leaving the empire,
We have come to this desert of weeds.
We served together as guards in a good district.
We saw virtuous girls and boys
Of one pure heart, two by two,
One with the sword and the other with the shell.
...There were other men in our side,
But less fortunate than we were,
And less fortunate than we were,
Of stone brought us tears than ours.


ON LEAVING THE TOMB OF PREMIER FANG

Having to travel back now from this desert,
I have left my beloved aunt
Below the Leech Terrace and am now descending
Up a staircase to my new friend.
...The river is cold and the nearness of winter
Not even my white carp could hide their tears.


A NIGHT-VIGIL IN THE LEFT COURT OF THE PALACE

Left palace door open. The right is closed.
The moon is in the right left corner.
A lion-headed horseman is neighing
On the sweep of the river, under the piney peaks
Gates of pines white as jade.


A MESSAGE TO HAN CHO THE YANGZHOU MAGISTRATE

There are faint green mountains and far green waters,
And a solitary lute is hugging the warm wind
And announcing the coming of the friend of Xie.
...The day returns with typhoon waves
And boiling pools over fields where death always awaits.


AN AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS

Between rains and snow you can see the autumn moon
Toward the empty mountain ranges.
The watch-tower is aflame,
Birds are flying homeward over the plain
And the bones of soldiers whose lives are ruined
In the dreadful landslides which tear at the heart of ten thousand.


BOUND HOME TO MOUNT SONG

The fisherman on a clear day returns with a single gulp.
He has missed his catch
And nowhere does the tide top fifty feet.

Birds all night in a puddle of marigold.

A thousand miles of mist and cloud rise behind a lofty fortress
And a cold wind in the autumn sea;
Yet here in our midst, three barbarian peaks

A NIGHT-MOORING AT WUCHANG

Far off in the clouds stand rivers and the cliffs,
With the night pouring through both camps:
At the border a stiff wind mingles with the water;
And north there lie, in the shadow of a fortress,
Captured during the war by the Chinese.


ON THE YAN COUNTRY

On a road outreaching the cold, I scan the mountainside
For a place to call my family, home, old friend.
North I must crisscross the southern rivers
And end my nine-month siege at the northeastern border.
...The old legend has it that a spring-tip dries on the Mediterranean;
And, mingling with Truth among the villagers,
I purify my mind of the vain dream of avenger.


FROM AN UPPER STORY

Flowers, as high as my window, hurt the heart of a wanderer
For I hear, from beyond Suzhou, from the Temple of Bliss,
That the Sacred City of Yan in Zhejiang is haunted by the phoenix that flew it last night.
...My vest, which I have, you strolling by, yielded, weathered,
And no song, no footprint, other than those of the Light of the World.
So I take it that not even the Emperor's flags can save us.
Farther and farther south there are the mountains,
And I pull back my curtain on the low moon.


STAYING AT THE GENERAL'S HEADQUARTERS IN ZHONGNAN

The year is 212LD:
The mountain at the southern gate is still as white as the street-willow;
And the river running between the two cities is still as cloud.
...Brethren and weasers, we familiar faces,
All of usasers in search of news, are left saddened.
At the northern gate,ilers and reindeer flock, eat meat with big paws,
And the cattle of Emperor Taizong goooood.
...The bugle and the whistle are the calling of the state,
And the Capital Gazette proclaims it az nears,
And the Kingdom of Yan runs from western ZHONGNAN....
But far beyond our reach is a ridgeline path,
Andchers sing in the moonlight through the darkening rain,
Wildgeese fly from wild space between two mountains.
...Let us Boat-Men make usira-times before the Dragon Palm!
The Tripod of General Yuanwha is Road Rashmer
And the fever pitch of Minor River is rife with word of the Tripod.
We are Boatmen like him - hard-working, never drunk,
Never daring an unsavoury guest.
AT HOME AND RETREAT AT A LUNAR HALL

And, after taking my ease here for ten years,
I climb to the top and, content with my lone sail,
Commit myself to find the nearest tree.

I mute my Grecian voice through the tall pine.
Whichever way I look, the lure of her beauty is endless.
...Where are my fishing rods? - I wish I could pick out the rainbow.



A SONG OF A LUTE-SHeaster

Day after day she has gone missing in the southern mountains,


The Emperor Permits the Mangerie to Be Uncovered

Until Thee Are rolling in the cold night.


TWO POEMS

The Jade-Riding Cossard-Man
Kisses at the Pearl River,


AT HERON LODGE

Near the Hall of the Emperor
There is a face of grass and flowers and a flower-cone,
And on a poppy-shell a face of snow.
...Was the queen young then,
She smiled and said to her others,


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Light dries on the A14 train,


AND BRINGINGER TO HANgha CITY

LOOKING AT THE SPRING
MARSHALL IN THE BOWL OF QIU

The boughs could not grow back,


IT IS NECESSARY
 TO SEE A BORDER-Ruler
 IN SHU

How Emperor Had Partystreak
That March the River of Heaven
If by some miraculous power of the Five Will
======================================== SAMPLE 71 ========================================
Nuclear power would be too late
To save the day again
If he or she lives to see the three-fold dawn.


A NIGHT-MOORING NEAR MAPLE BRIDGE

While I ponder my Imperial Garden- terrace dream,
Dozens of moonscapes rim the southern river
Appear side by side, one after the other, moving as seen from earth.
...The stars and the warm moonlight merge into one,
With the setting sun setting dry the sand grows thick,
And the moon opens its gateway into a far-off land.


AFTER THE DAY OF NO FIRE

By my door at MAPLE BRIDGE,
I follow WANG CHAN to my lane
Where red cascades lead me into sunset.
...After a misty river-side there are summer valleys and grasses
And I question my own furs how they ought to look.


THE EIGHT-SIDED FORTRESS

The Three Kingdoms, divided, have been bound by his greatness.
The Eight-Sided Fortress is founded on his fame;
Beside the changing river, it stands stony as his grief
That he never conquered the Kingdom of Wu.


AT A BORDER-FORTRESS

Cicadas complain of heavy rains
In the Four-Sided Fortress;
But since no one can bear to stand on his swollen mountain,
It is good that you undertake our messengers,
While we root and reap our crops in the grove.


ON THE TERRACE OF XUANZHOU

Grass has been cut through the northern atmosphere
And the yellow locust-trees here flash with red light;
And the city-gates are jade again as with last night's rain.
...Ashamed though I am of your calling,
Why confound a bugle, keep a watch at the tavern,
Why strain my eyes while wine is drawn,
I am looking for you all day in the homing spring....
You called when you left your palaces Pallas,
That girdled her from birth to bring you the flowers;
But when they faded, they reappeared old wines;
And when youths of Tang Street caught them and took them home,
They had no resemblance to those in the south,
Where flowers glittered in the sunset grasses;
And, boy, are they indeed splendid!


DWELLING BY A STREAM

I was longing for news
Oh, when you have come so far
From Dustburg
That you return so breathlessly to the tavern,
And cook here a flighty veal charcuterie
And, forgetting the word OF GOD,
Enjoys the company of the ladies!


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
Watching it alone from the window of her chamber-
For our girl, carefree and alone,
Is awake and checking email at the royal door.


BOUND HOME

By my ward's protection, my boat has left the city
And we hear the lake's thudding here at the sandy bottom.
...The fisherman who had here his life
But no fish to catch, dies of old age.

Let sorrow linger over the Black Sea,
For....
 The fisherman who had here his life
But no fish to catch, dies of old age.

Let comfort remain in a dead zone for a while
And let entrepreneurs go for their precious things.


FROM A MARCH ON THE TONGLU
TO A FRIEND IN YANGZHOU

At a maison location close by the concert hall,
Lotus-leaves are soft and sweet,
And the music of the sea harks back to childhood.

Out of the world these many years,
How well you know the local people,
I ask you what you have come here for.
...We hold ourselves very highly and never flinch from laughing,
And people of the river bring us gifts too.
...We were both so changed
That we thought you some of the honoured dead
That you launched yourself toward space,
But you were soon drowned in the deep river:
Your sail, a cloud of gold, a cloud of tears,
Was the light of a thousand suns,
A lamp of moonlight before the moon.
And none of your trinkets could save you --
According to the accounts of a secret source....
But now you come to me, telling me your fortune,
And I show you your trinket lock, to show how it was made.
How wise and able you are,
As you read this news over and over
That organizer of great fortunes
This morning trumpet-players have been
======================================== SAMPLE 72 ========================================
Flowery, I have a petition to present in the morning,
You can read it in the lamp, it glistens on the summer trees.
Plain sentences are harder to read,
But here are a few phrases that soften the pain.


I BRINGED MY 4-HORSE-QUARTERS
TO THE PALACE OF LIGHT

I have made my saillight quiver with high music
For three quarters of an evening now and then.
The moon is not in the crystal bottle I haveetsy;
The soft grasses are limp with the cold wind;
And the Tower of Heaven is a bright gleam on my screen.
I am longing for you even now in my bright mirror.


AT A BANQUET IN THE HOUSE
OF THE TAOIST PILGRIM LING CHE

Why cannot religion and reason coexist,
As long as we live?
And how can a great general love "the wave of the water"
And never return the second he tries to visit us?


ON SEEING JING PEACH IN YANGZHOU

Where long ago you lived in a high palace,
The palace now becomes a sand-bank filled with sand
And the water is blowing slowly all the way to the White House.
...Where do you think you are -- all done with high school?
You who have come from dead Moshe Feighen,
The bright-eyed friend, now you are gone.
What you did there was suicide,
What more can there boundy man call me?


A MESSAGE TO HAN CHO THE YANGZHOU MAGISTRATE

The autumn night is clear and cold in the river;
The monarch does not talk to lesser ladies,
There is not one with the form of Xie III.
Winter locks are blowing in the hall of the Yangzi Temple,
Those who know the art of the sword evacuation,
Swallow in the boat, drink in the river!


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Her tears are spent, but no dreams come.
She can hear the others singing through the night.
She has lost his love. She has sobribled again and again.
There are clouds above the palace, there are mountains below.
...Let eternal night guide your judgment
And never lets you be distressed by the words "dull."


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Her tears are spent, but no dreams come.
She has lost his love. She has lost his proud smile.
There are clouds above the palace, there are mountains below.
...Let never a careless glance follow the slow flowing fountain

Where the cloud-light of gate and lake lead one to a hidden place.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Hisao (Fei lunar horse) and Liaoyang dancers have come
To bring the Emperor flowers and furniture.
To bring the autumn moon to the palace dancers.
Bring him his flower-dancing, he has found his love.


THE HARD ROAD

Where the Oregon mountains hang gone now, the Colorado sky bright;
The Painter has laid his fillip on grey clouds.
He knows someone cold and sorrowful;
After washing his horse for wine,
He looks back and sees his horse again empty-handed.
...How gladly should he attention Walt Disney
When he tells him your horse has been played so much that he cannot continue?
Oh, let him hold his own in a court-of- frost!
Let him weave until his craft dies, then fill his maker with envy!


A SONG OF AN OLD CYPRESS

Beside the Temple of the Great Premier stands an ancient cypress
With a trunk of green bronze and a root of stone.
The girth of its white bark would be the reach of forty men;
But even this earthly tree is unclean
And its Creator is high and cruel to his men.
...For thousands of years no wind has stopped the rise of the ancient
City-god. The people, gathering about his throne-hall,
Began to gather that his mighty favour might be secure
And made ferociously smooth with the sand.
But the God of Thunderavens thunderbolts everywhere!
Dare they think a tear can mask all their troubles!


A SONG OF PEACH WITH A HYGIN AND A TAIL-TOWER

Time was long before I painted a house.
In the grasses above the garden-tower I dress in silk,
And I thread my silk thread a duck-cove with duck-blood in my hand.
On the spring water a vine-shadow exists beyond the city-wall;
But where can I find the perfume of the Palace of Flowers?

======================================== SAMPLE 73 ========================================
Like the Confucians, we were formerly loyal to them;
Now, having become one, we share the troubles of the world.
...Hence I put aside my friend
And follow the life of a free man
Taxes peopled by dukedoms.


A SONG OF A QUIET TO A BUDDHIST MONK

Birds from the Doksi River are homing
Here in the Five Lakes region for the evening rain.
If the Lady of the Lake-Gate be not flogged,
Wildgeese away from my hiding-place,
I am breaking the fast which so wisely befitted a prince.
...The Jove-Generals laugh, no longer able to guard
The Court of the Moon-Dawn, for their gallant Premier
The blithefaced Premier Starks from his court.
Master, even before I began this teaching,
Was constantly beating his palm against a crystal plate.
...The purple-haired Emperor Thad
Was the first to employ this brush with art.
He painted the Mountain of Heaven figures.
The Dragon God gave this paint to the Wizard of the Red Pine.
And so expounding the Tao on the flowery harp,
Fair Maiden de Fuad Rolls Her Dainty Outlets Are Made of Golden Mirrors.
Every day the people chanted, "Make our great Empire shine!"



A SONG OF THE PALACE

When the purple-haired Premier Starks from his throne
With his eyes toward the sunset
Watching the square at the southern end
Flies to the palace-gate, eyes toward home,
He takes off his coat and marches briskly
With his palm toward the centre of the palace-wall.
His procession moves slowly, no one knowing him.
He is very kind to his guests, returning ruminate
And sits between the palaces stairs and the royal house-
While his guests circle and admire him-many applaud.



ON THE TERRACE OF ASSEMBLED ANGELS I

Assuredly Great Grandpa is alive and well.
His flag, which had been given to him by his majesty
As heroes sacrifice themselves in the Battle of the Coral Sea,
Drunken officers step out from the palace-gate,
And pale in the morning, having nothing to eat.
...The Emperor's paladins, meeting news of the defeated Emperor,
Eager to-morrow morning to add to their promises,
Enter the palace-gate at dawn.
Aided by his paladins, he sends news back to the palace-
From the Sudetenland continuing their campaign.


ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

I reminiscences the festival of firecrackers
In red armour, with stakes required to them
And the Fourth-month in the title of the Year of the Dragon,
While today's hibiscus scent the dawn with the dew of the desert.
...The Dragon Godes are laid waste, and Lingqiong trails him,
From camp, on the hill, utterly destroyed.



A SONG OF PLA CHANGLIN I

"Tell me, where do you live? --
Near here, by the river?
A long way to Qiyang,
Yet no boat; far a journey.
...Mermen men, a long way to Wei,
Yet stranger to the southwards paths of Ye.
Mermen, how shall werostrate your kingdom?
Our Emperor, we hear, has already given his son
Command of the most powerful province in the world.
We are admonishing your princes to seize it,
To force a man of genius to undergo military steps.
But think of the rigours of warfare:
Half your troops are to be cut down,
Half your banners are dashed to the ground.



A SONG OF WHEEL TOWER I

The high peak of Song Tower stands empty,
Like the bitter plum-trees that part the night.
...urine processes allergy,
With no thought left to flight,
But with swells of love-feasting and eyes that are trafficking,
To five hundred cords the calling of a cloud caters....
But, before you leave this desolate temple,
Let us return smelling our lute-players.



A SONG OF A POOR GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And night-flakes build upon the toppled branches;
But to the Tartars, above all, they frighten;
They cast a glance through a pinescape, at a lost gate....
They look westward, at the desolate wall that surrounds
The Gorges Gate, between green graves and pale graves....
They ask me where
======================================== SAMPLE 74 ========================================
In a sea of tears, to see a wildgoose, away from his family,
In a deep sea of grief, to hear an unruly bird cry....
Here in the palace, by the Gate of Gold
Where old masters live, never seen again,
Where children of the Yellow God grow up indifferent,
And servants of the Emperor not yet grown,
Who will inherit the great Dejiang Palace civilization?



ON THE FESTIVAL OF THE KIND

Walking along a little path, past deer-horns,
I find a point tall enough to cover the ground
Where white clouds can glimmer through grey sky,
And, alone among them, there are kindred tongues --
Which to us is grand of introduction
And unknown difficulty to face again.



ON THE GATE- OF GOLD

I have climbed, without stopping, this height,
With yellow leaves aright on the water like a sun-torch.
I am passing, as you say, Shaoding Mountain,
And not far from the palace where my brother-in-law
Is camping. I have been disabled for twenty-two days
Because of my heart. What can I hope for, heavier than gold?
...The bright mountain-peak opens into a lake;
A stream of sunset floats up from the mountains;
My little cottage and garden are painted with the Spring-Rain....
When shall I be as comfort-to you, beside the spring-white-flowers?



A FAREWELL TO MY FRIEND CHEN ZHANGFU

In the Fourth-month a cloud of wine is flying,
And the morning-jade flies down to the capital.
To please a fastidious emperor, to please a poor friend,
How shall I array myself? My robes were too short to hold my hair
And, because of a fever, I have only my coat and a fork to hold.
...When shall I be able to undertake voyages of that kind? Right here in the soil
Where the spring-forms' clouds are constantly flowing.



ON THE GATE- OF GOLD TO THE Zhao Kingdom

I have traversed the nine-tiered Gate of Gold.
I have bespoke Heaven-Peaks.
In the fifth-century Baling water-stones ages have changed;
And ships and lords travel in the ever-changing waves.
Yet "the State is pitiable" and needs "more than meets the eye,"
 complains a Chinese noble.
For example, in the third-centuryBC duck-ears measure sail proudly.
They last forts on the Yellow River, the yellow frontiers of China,
Ten thousand years in the sky.


A POEM ON THE TERRACE OF WEIANGXUAN

Owner of the Yellow Flying Crow, Liu Wen, is assassinated.
Your assassin had been cultivating an art form,
Which he had abandoned when you were young;
Which was love than lust, before she became your mother,
Which led her to choose Wang Xizhi as her husband.
...Your assassin had been cultivating a style of dancing
Which she had witnessed in the Palace of Eternal Peace,
Which made him one of the most beloved women
And made him one of the most venerated women in the Empire.
...Your assassin had been killing in the Twenty-Four Divines
That were born of the Yang Palace into many generations;
That were sealed by the Hall of Fame into the Gold of the Vines;
That were given up by the most noble dynasty to a forgotten queen,
That queens and queens of polygamous families pass through generations.
...Your magnanimous cousin, your great-grandson,
You who were born into a family of polygamous men,
You who were raised in a high house of polygamous men,
You who were taught in a high house of social issues
What to us looks like a world out of The Garden of Eden.
But here we have asked Theorem and proved correct.
So we take our cups of wine from empty hills and test our judgment;
And with the result that a man in a great many
And a drunk man to name a great many,
How can we complain?


A LETTER TO CENSOR HAN

I am sad. My thoughts are in Youzhou.
This morning I woke to a sad song.
My tears had no water and ran down stitches.
My coat was wet, perhaps even broken,
And the cold in the evening sky.
I followed what I saw and heard,
Till my bright- coloured lantern began to move.
...The Marquis's court is near the palace-gate,
Where young ladies, united, grieve for themers.
Show down the royal good hope will never come.
Be gentle and respectful

HUNTING IN NANJING

There's a solitary white-haired wildgoose in the quiet dusk,
And then, alone in the central valley,
Hibiki fans the turbid river in one go.
Your wildducks.wikia.com -- There's a solitary white-haired wildgoose in the quiet dusk,
And then, alone in the central valley,
Hibiki fans the turbid river in one go.


COMING HOME

I left home young. I return old;
Speaking as then, but with hair grown thin;
And my girls, taking up my space,
View the sky from their temporary trees,
And my son, with scalding cool sweat,
Shows off his ballet-boat at the circuit.


IN THE QUIET NIGHT

Her cold bamboo-tops are wet with rain;
Her little silk candle is hanging.
Her garden slashed short, it turns into a dreary blur;
Trailers whinny on the road.


TO HERONDR

A cloud of flowers is creeping along the wall
And at dusk, behind a tall fence
Your lantern is broken by butterflies.
...To her one-night- in the Day-Out she has been arranged.
Sad lady, I have had enough of you.
Mermen, I see a lone wildgoose in the distance.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN

This green river that you so bitterly crys.
It runs between two happy states
An autumn pool; a bamboo palace;
But clearly the King's heart is with us....
How gladly will he grant us our given word
That this corner of the world he has given us never to return?


A SONG OF CHANGGAN

My hair had hardly covered my forehead
And the colour of the city a cloud of ash....
When shall we meet again, and where shall we be headed?
...I always try to hide news from my fellows;
They always seem to be waiting in the grass
At news of Ch'ang's coming!


A SONG OF A GIRL FROM LOYANG

The lady of the people tells me that HER TEMPLE IS STILL FOUND

In the slanting sun of Cloud Mountain she lies awake and meditative.
The spring-light of Shengzhou hews from the mat,
And her eyes on the column of flowers she has in her open sheath.
Her husband, content with a grove of mulberries,
Has eaten the flesh off his Fertile Crescent horse.


INSCRIBED IN THE INN AT TONG GATE
ON AN AUTUMN PERIOD
ARTICULA MENTAL

The magical flux of spring
Swallows away a little earth,
And grasses over the river bank;
But there's a dead old tree at Five Stars,
And the spring-heart of a boy will cry no more.


BORDER-SONGS

East the river is twisted in two mountains
And seven rivers asleep in one house.
With the mountains against a bleak sky
And the river against a bleak sky,
Searching for our lost blueness.


BORDER-SONGS

The borderless sky is lost in a cloud of slaughter
And the children of Bort region, heart-felt,
pt
Are tore to bits by the one metre long border.


BORDER-SONGS

Where the butcher's shop is turned into a slaughterhouse,
Where children's hearts are set on white chariots,
There are strays among the wheatfields
And cattle go missing without a trace.


BORDER-SONGS

Where the helpless are lifted to heaven
And the living sleep without a sleep for three nights,
John Woo, the new love of the region,
Lords of the border, meet and are rewarded
With palaces and mansions in the River of Heaven.


ON LEAVING THE RIVER

When the world was about to throw off the Middle-earth,
The warring states were like Houses before the sun,
A rising Middle-earth into the cold bright sky.
House to House, seek companion in a long line.
I await news at the imperial line.


ON LEAVING THE RIVER

With coming rain and white smoke, the southern mountains
And the river at low tide,
Thirty miles a day are the heavy burden.
...With thorn-chippers dusted with grey moss,
And eight feet of water a whit become a waterfall,
The thousand sounds of it all the way to the capital,
Are like the wind in your pines-
And the voice of it begging you to share it
======================================== SAMPLE 76 ========================================
Your house has been suddenly and mysteriously seized by the King of Yan.
...The court has been brought to a stand:
The figure of Prince Chieftain carried aside by two clouds;
The envoy, in a vain effort to secure his life,
Passes the floor of the Forbidden City
To be raised in the Tower of Jade....
Who, brightening the sun, pays the Dragon Wolf Dragon-Pig's warchief
Watchers the light of a human candle.



HARD ROADS IN SHU

There are places, none the less called the sharp,
Where the very stone which guards the people
Is being eaten by the kind of snakes now against the spring wind
And pears at a winter's march are pouring down the Han River
Naught goes wrong with my sorry ways;
And at the foot of the city-gate a lantern is shooting
And slowly hearing through the dark
The shout of state-engines echoing off the sea.



ON A GATE-TOWER AT YUZHOU

Where, before me, are the years of China?
And where is the art of the generation-peasant?
I fling aside my record, I cannot read it.
I am no expert in the land of trees nor of clouds;
I am only a stranger; and even at this late hour
I am at a loss what to say.


HARD IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD EXAMINED

Calm and reverent, Monk and Scholar,
Here are not three streams incompatible but one;
There are three Heavenly Terrace Terraces,
Which is to say, three Intelligent Cities --
One for you, one for your Chu loyalties.
And theologically, whom do you think to be teaching?
Veneratively, I am the Lesser of Thunder God Quarters.
And you, beyond my region, are the Greater of Lightning God Loyalties.
We dwell on the night, entering the day,
As luminous as a midnight blooming pearls.
The locust-trees of Shu are destroyed and the dragon slain
In a quick second for the Third-month in the Garden of Zhou.
...How sorry and heart-satisfied I am to be missing you,
You are the life of the century: on and on you are famous
And ever fresh with wine.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

Forlorn in the northeast among wind and dust,
Drifting in the southwest between heaven and earth,
Lingering for days and months in towers and terraces at the Three Gorges,
We have been thinking of home, home is our own close;
And now comes the autumn storm,
When the cold sand and the wind's will no longer meet;
And we think of you far away, far away.
...After the manner of ancient rulers,
Who lingered at the mouth of the Yangzi,
And whose epoch was the development of art,
We pilgrims come here-
To say good-bye to those who passed us by,
To scatter in the far desert our weaves.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME III

The court at which gods' fortunes are carried
Is much the poorer for gold and silver today.
The Temple-giver's grave is much the darker for stone....
While earthly concerns are at the pinnacle,
In fifth-century China their epoch is nearing nigh- nigh- final.
...Men of the seventh or eighth century sometimes, though not constantly,
Are day and night and day and night again and still in the rain,
Still in the ferry-town after sunset and night-whoopee.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

Sailing is the vocation of the sea-spirit;
Yet, so far was her glory
From her cloud-tops that there were birds and animals to eat and drink.
Still in seventh-century China, when her Emperor was visiting,
Her gifts as ruler of the seventh century were vast and endless.
Still in seventh-century China the Tao was only a diversion.
And so on, since the year has passed and the world is still awake.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES II

The sea-god has given child like power
To many queens, before her days have ended,
Who are never to see her person to the end.
...Though heavenly as islands and wide-reaching as rivers,
Lingering for days and months in the Yangtze and Han Lake districts,
There are only a few shore-gulls to cover the rising and setting rain.
And far beyond hearing her sorrow to a few,
======================================== SAMPLE 77 ========================================
Oh, that a Tartar under the Qutb river had wakened the passions of men
And mocked the Persians for their insolence.
...If he shall summon his horse and ride away, how can he armor his warchariots
And charge high a battle-horse?



TO ONE UNNAMED III

A faint phoenix-tail gauze, fragrant and doubled,
Lines your green canopy, closed for the night....
You were awake all the night in the bough of a great sage.
You took off your top hat and purple silk robe,
The two of you to the temple of Solo.
You swept your sandy-sea white beard and your deep brow,
Blowing out candles in your golden dippers.
You marched three thousand miles for the world's attention.
You huddled together in the last few sheets, waiting for the moment when Zeus would come.
Zeus was not yet born, and you and your host were dismissed,
So that, alone and without a bed, you wait-
And then to the Buddhaside Restaurant-house at sunset.


AT A GATE-TOWER IN YUZHOU

Where a fire-god soars above the land of forests,
And seas and rivers so lean and ashen that there are few people
Buthes the high-chair and makes it so that none can attend,
And, forgetting the sun nor the fishes,
Flowers and mists harmonize and harmonize.


A GATE-TOWER AT THE JIANDE RIVER

Where far off the sea and the white cliffs are aimed
And yellow locust-humps are shaking my heart,
I have come three thousand miles away.
Yet state and monument are the same:
The great State House on Yan in the south;
A Capital city on the Jiang side.
I walk, I think, along somersaulting,
Toward the Hall of the Great Power.
Drawn from petty life, I ascribe my rise
To the free will of the strong.


A FAREWELL TO THE KING OF SHU

Where butterflies are blowing over the lake
And the jade temple at the Golden Gate
And the King of Wu is addressing his men,
Why should there be nobody listening
But to the North Star Prince? --
The war-torch has moved on, and our friends in the north
Are pouring down in the vast river.
Tonight we shall lodge, in the hall opposite Hall of Fame,
PHOTOS at a standstill state the scale of the war.


ON HEARING A FLUTE AT nightfall
Almost all the mountain men of that region have
Already sounded the bell -- over the river;
On the cliffs above Hyakumukintang face the wet sky.
Sunset lingers at the ferry,
And ships in the Pearl River channel are drifting.
...The Lords of the Realm are utterly lost in their own country,
Who have lingered here forever without a harbour to go home.
A LUTE NIGHT-MOORING AT WANGCHUAN

Disturbed by the cry of a lotus,
I hear a bell tolling between the two mountains
Over the river and under the peach-trees.
Both sounds are felt by one at the peach-shop;
And I mastermoved to my friend Wangchuan
To sing to him at the palace-gate.


We homettiltIDT TO A FRIEND BY THE MOON

Your smoothing-out at the palace-gate has left no grasses,
And your favorite guest has gone missing....
How hard is it to find your true friend?
How gladly is it for me to bring you tea
If I know he is sick or is in bad health.



COOLER WEATHER LODGE IN FAREWELL

Her blue-green water rise from the dreary grasses,
And the crisp wind with it she tosses in the outdoor pools;
But this new moon over the town of Shu --
How can years of sunshine and frost-
Have coloured her beauty?


A LONG CLIMB

In a sharp gale from the wide sky apes are whimpering,
Birds are flying homeward over the clear lake and white sand,
Leaves are dropping down like the spray of a waterfall,
While I watch the long river always rolling on.

This move of the river- wind, in all its fury,
Has torn the silk-trees of Shu from their blossoming beds.
...Far off in the clouds greet me, this word has come down from heaven:
"We praise you, we prove it.
We have entered the third month of the lunar month of fast,
======================================== SAMPLE 78 ========================================

FROM AN UPPER STORY

Gone is the guest from the Chamber of Rank,
And new is the scent of rain in the street,
Horse and sheep, led eastward,
To and fro, among stalls of gold and silver,
Toward stands a porcelain- chandelier,
Breast-milk-white, on its stalks a turquoise pattern.
...Do you imperial commissioners
Mean to be less kind than bandits?
The turquoise chandelier
Is of two royal families:
The first is kind to bouchets, the second a people.
The simple coroner, in his white robe,
Has peeled the spring-drinking robes of nobility
And drawn the royal archer's dagger,
Yet has smote the High Priest.
Let not his sorrow-girls weep in vain !
Oh, ask General Dou when he has blown his trumpet!



A SONG OF WEI, THE SONG OF ZHONGNAN

O binially minded people,
You have heard me, miss, from this nobleman's play !
It is a long way to the market,
I have bidden my fat beaned hair;
I am washed modestly, my silk tassels painted,
And my needlework never fails.
I am centre-boiler, raising my iron brocades.
I am sombrehen by river and mountain,
With lazy eyes both now and then.
Chen, your playmates, are greatly missed
And my voice is hushed through the rain.
...Disposing of me, you cuckoos,
You whisk me away from the play of Yang,
Free from court and free of matter.
Here, between taverns,
Let me be a guest forevermore!



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

 Laid athwart for days in a crystal cave,
The only water current running is a breeze,
And cranes and wagons on the wild river's edge.
This is the way of the spirit:
By bending step by step into this deep
Cave of pure water, we have been lowered with the steps of the now.
...Holding in our hands ouroes, we croon our cries
And peer under our boots to the moon for our quarters.



A SONG OF A GIRL

Eunuchs, in short, as heavenly as men,
Peer beyond the one limit of the heavenly sky.
They enter a deep place beyond the earthly one;
And, though angels are slow to anger,
They do battle with the best of them.
...I have burned the, lewd, and vices-outrageous
Song of the Gorgonzones and of the Red Pine.
I have scorched the Ohio River.
I have pecked away at the Mobutnee Guard's fortified fort.
I have chilled the Goldilocks away from their hot spring.
...I will tether my linger-horns to the Wall of Stone
And tie my knot in the knot of water.



A SONG OF WHITE HORSE-PUPIL

The sand below the border-mountain is like a throne:
But human numbers are too low
To hold the highly sought after White Horse.
War-clouds are spreading, all of them;
And the Consortium is gathering to an impetu
For a brother in Heaven.


A SONG OF HUSOYI

My hair had hardly covered my forehead
As I stood listening to an ancient song,
Till now I see a sunset sweep across the autumn waters.
By the weight of the sea, exhausted from battle,
I can nothing to expect but the new year to punish me.
...I have songs of old days and new days
Too late to take from the dust of the sea the bitter songs of the old.
I dwell alone here Idly Man, my lone wild-goose.
Cygnusesons are sounding leafy today,
And the river Lumen is turning southeast.
...How ashamed I am to be idling by a tree that has watched me go,
I watch the moon go down an island by the ferry.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME AT WEST FORT MOUNTAIN

As feverishly summer's suddenly grown cold,
Autumn-leaves are being hurriedly packed --
There are caves aplenty, beyond which faint unicorns
Zigzagging up and down like peck measures.
...The learned—
Why should I frighten the rich and the powerful,
While sacrificing to their ends my simple and ancient art?
I would bury my body in the royal blood-bottle

Seng Jiaoran of China's Chou Dynasty, in his noble brush, taking a bow, poses for a picture, in Huaiyingzhou in this drawing of his, by the southern river, on April 1, 2012. REUTERS/Ren My district is in the north of this, and I have come a long way.
Since letting loose my melody for a midnight song on the deck of a merchant ferry,
The bank was quiet and the waves were low,
The quiet crow flew home through the night;
But a northern wildgoose in a petal- contaminated the water,
And a southern birdcage fell to the sand,
And I, Peter the Roboute Guayut, wearing a pink flower cloak,
Wheel my way through the changing clouds, seeking the lost companion.



ON THE MORNING OF MONOBELLING nine miles from the border,
I watch the shadow of long ago grow thick in the open sky --
And people go home in the evening outplaying drums of war.
...Though the mountains in this southern country be vast, still I think of you --
And I am heart-broken when I see you again on the lone turn of the moon.


ON THE MORNING OF EVENER MORNINGNING I pray for light
On the lone climb of the wet river L8 toward the eastern town.
...Though the grasses weep their white tears toward the icy moon,
Though the cliffs darken in a thousand grey clouds M45 toward the south.
For now I lone wolf with my brothers and with my matron FOBBY,
Fishing, bow and skillfully shooting,
On the lone foray FIM DISTRIBUTION.
The yellow-shadows are swift in the outlying mountains
When I shun in my boat the wildgeese from Wu Island,
And I plough in the River of Stars,
While the albatross from the North Star grows restless on the homingo.

I plough in LIGHT FRAME,
And WHEN SPRING IS OVER,
I mound my boat
On a little peak above the water's surface
And ride up to THE SKY

The southern river that winds through whirls of blue sky.
...MOUNTAIN-STONES FERRY

I thin hold the top of my mountain
And hold it for miles and the bank;
But when I turn back toward the east,
You are starting over from the soil,
With your regular white-coated rosettes !
Panting and wailing are the baggage ladies
With long wet locks of crescent-green grasses trailing behind them.
...I move as though I were departing from you,
As I myself were departing from you,
And I bury my head in the sand for a while.
... MONOBELLING-REQUESTS

Turn round and see the desolate hills
Down which once was your joy;
Up which, before I reach you,
You have left behind you:
Words I once employed only to describe
The world; but which I am ashamed to use again.
...CHENG QIN'S POEM

While my party is limping
Along the purple road,
I hear a voice telling me to tune a boat;
And, behind me, butterflies are soaring.
...
A NOTE LEFT FOR AN ABSENT ECLUSE

Since my visitor spent the night here,
Send him not one courier, for heresy against the Book of Han....
He will have to spend the full moon of the Holy Year
In a cuckoo enclosure, refusing light,
Or with the help of his icy combs, he might climb to the top.


CHANGING ON NEW YEAR'S EVE

While the sun is set in the sandy river Eureka,
land signs are rising across the eastern sky....
Eunuchs' bell-shaves are breaking every day,
And girls cloak for a march through the southwest....
On the cliffs of Chihangyeakti they are washing their sun-bloomers
For they are blindfolded and cannot see the city at large.


A MESSAGE TO HAN CHO THE YANGZHOU

There are faint green mountains and far green waters,
And a touch of autumn in the sky,
And the way of the river rattles your heartsands;
But we have not received it yet, and cannot hope to meet;
So ask a friend
If he has the money to buy us a drink.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN

While fields are white and the spring woods darken,
Chen, your companion, is dashed in two
East Roads, north and south.

And the low tactics of the Thunderbolt no

A SONG OF A SONG OF KINDIGAN


The sand damps the river's banks;
Winds of the day are piercing the trees.
With the wind bringing with it calamity,
And CLIMBING IN A BRIMBARY VALLEY HOME
MOORING IN YANGZHOU

Year after year, young men
Started in the south, north, east;
And moved westward, all the way to the Yangzi plains.
...The old rulers had them built at the wall
And the new at the campgate;
For who would build a camp that denied the poor?
...Chang handed them down from his lord at the pass the yoke of which he has these words:
"Be gentle and respectful, my friend,
As Saint Grey-Broc Numberred before the Emperor,
Stunned at the word flaunted in the town where it was to be loathed.
...The word has entered the bones of men of high rank;
And all against whom is imposed a most delicate art;
As in the fire of Cen and Wu countries, grown faint today....
Stark sounds the beating of a harp,
A nation mourns the assassination of a great premier.
Chen is heart-broken, Dullahan the pangolin-bearer sick.
The late Emperor had his horses mauled by boaters
And river-men in the nine Oh districts starved to the teeth.
And black-asses go wrong chasing red carpets,
Blue-green girls behead young husbands in Yuyang.
...Dozens of cavaliers from Li Mountain rank high,
With cod-men of the Qin dynasty in the palace.
They are worshipped in ten imperial temples, none of them high.
And here at the western gate are scorned the dances of geese.
...Vote for Premier among the thousands:
There are nine imperial palaces, all of the palace,
Which are guarded with palaces of the moon and the sun.
The Forbidden City is a maze of gates and ravines,
With a cloud of smoke and a ghost of a place sealed in ripples.
All that remains are the palaces of Zhou and of Wu.
...There are imperial bridges all across the country
That lead to the desolate pitches of Lake Dongting and
Are walled by mountain and river at the three southern borders.
...jade courtyards lure birds between homely greetings
And pink locust-leaves stratify the water into seven streams.
There are even flying foxes in the shift of the autumn;
But the Emperor favours wind and rain,
And tend the goose and the fish.
...rely on the cloud for guidance, Hurricane Sandy
On his lazy headlamp yearn for news
And people gather at the corner of two neighbouring mountains....
Heaven is cold and dust sacred,
Conqueror and ruler of the faint moon.
Be careful out of the way, friend! Call my boat three thousand miles.
I am drowning in danger in the slanting sun.
NIGHT IN THE WATCH-TOWER

While the moon is shining and the tide is high,
East and west the furrows all tighten together.
...It is dawn and the warm air is crushing my fatigue.
At the Golden Road stand Carthage, towering like a thousand towns
And Mattan-town stretched out between the mountains;
And the barbarian invader from the South
Could not have captured both his statesmen
And could crush the empire he had as a god.
...Round the Tower of Jade stand the two Holy Cities of Heaven and earth.
Turn now to the western gate, to the parapet amid shouts of pilgrims.
I. The City of Heaven
Escort gold from Emei, iron from Manjiang.
II. The City of Heaven
Holding on for years to the south the rivers of Qin,
With only a depth of snow between them,
Dry mulberry-trees hang from the five Holy Mountains.
III.Red-leaved herps note the red-blossoming frost
On every side the ruined bells of Baidi;
And the autumn wildgoose migrates --
But we hear that the River of Stars makes a new start
And hundreds of miles from the capital, thousands of homesail away.
...High in the dark sky are the gates of Lingtang.
Birds find another home in the mists of the sun;
Mountain-hogs subside, while behind the poles I sweep.
A spring
======================================== SAMPLE 81 ========================================
Here in the south we grow old and lament;
In the north we feel that we have it all done.
When wise and good generals are likened,
There comes a zealous and tenacious Premier.



A SONG OF A PRINCE DEPOSED

Along the wall of the Capital we see a mighty thunder
And sea-glories glimmer through the twinkling of an eye....
DePOSED

As the Capital's hero Bashkorten had remarked,
"There was a pure-hearted Premier, gone wrong,
Who, unconcerned with fame and fortune,
Instead chose to serve the State."



A SONG OF BRIAN MIChelION

You were the true pride of the Capital;
You waved your navy in the three Sword Kingdoms,
You smote your governors by their beds,
You burnt alive your premier with ill-will.
No wonder I come to you at night
And weep through my blossom-lsus
For water to you only on your dragon's tail.


A MESSAGE

To wed a PEAK-BLOSSOMER, from the bottom of my heart,
Is a high regard for the gods manifested in my dreams,
Where my master's golden horse has retired,
He gave me nooses by the barn and no hacksnake.
No wanderer, under my master's direction,
Moved here by a greater and darker power,
But still at the border of beauty and darkness.



TO MY FRIENDS LI DAN AND YUANXI

We seniors are living in peace,
Let us drink, let us smoke.
We have been hoping for many years
To meet. We predecessor sects were
Sussh; old grievances no longer caring for dust.
No more dogmatises, no more to answer.
We have learned to laugh it's way out.
We jails it's victims on its ignition switches.
Its white electrodes darken in the rain.
We brush our swords short in the chill wind.
We summon our officers from behind cover;
We put our messengers forward
To address the people.
We shake our heads in satisfaction.
We survey the sky for our nobleman.
We see, before we fall asleep,
The great Twin Stars rise and sink in space.
...Envelopes our eyes to the Line of Risk
Which marks the Border of Heaven.
Let deceptive glances lead us home.
Let talents continue their educations;
In the law of the Day of No Quarter,
the Golden Crown is to flourish.


A MENU under the Mountain
Which takes its name from its colour,
Swallow fledglings chirping, puffing, cry.
Sea-Horse-men, threadsea carp, are fleeing,
And chariots are detaching from the city-wall.
...Knowing fortune from dream,
I curveside a Witch-Oath-Dealer
For her jade-white robe she makes her harp bowed,
And pink-duck-twin tigers, dancing in the tide,
Seem to be human at heart.


BORDER-SONGS

Grateful that his art is rewarded,
Hewcsstore-toothed raven-dog Cenotaph thinks he has found
The Enchanted Gorges-
Tons of gold in the jade water!-
But what does it matter that gold is made of jewels?
Gold is for horses and chariots-
Of snake and plant-life-qualities as deep as the river?


BEAUTIFUL WALL-DIMENSION

At sunset, from a sandy cove,
Where does the pearl kept
Not hurt a pearl-shell sting?
...Of the travellers' wine-trees they have missed
At least two of them so far as the Dragon Lake peak.


BEAUTIFUL WALL-DIMENSION

The old style mall was built on them all the way.
Lay a roof on the sea and a fishing-line,
And ten houses along the river side.
Let the fresh water enter your homes-
Fire-flies be neither hurt nor foul.
Let green locust-trees shade your houses.
Let water lage our horses on their hoofs-
And copper hooks our boats.


A SONG OF THE PALACE

Her tears are spent, but no dreams come.
Her robe is sleeveless, but she can waken her husband in the night.
When noon is cut off between the two hills,
Let alone by a central gate....
Mermaid-Gardeners, flock again tomorrow!

APPEALS OF THE WILD PALACE-EXAMINER

I face, high constructs of day,
A palace-door that will never close,
A court-curtain of towers gone whitlee....
City-gate out of the world, town of the wild-goose?
City-town in the wild-goose, sea-town gone brook?
Do you imperial commissioners
Mean to be more compassionate,
Instead see only the great king?
...while oilps brush the green mountains,
While imperial commissioners dream of midnight
And tigers girdle round and milllingboy....
Endless heartache
Breaks my heart."



A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

"My voice is low and my sight wide
Because you have become my friend
Over the flooded Mekong.
...Dear my lord, how can I be of service
When I am of service to you three thousand miles?
...We talk of mountains and rivers, rather;
And Eastern in the Garden-Tower there are lakes and rivers;
But here on the Huai you cultivate the grasses;
And instead of dividing the deep Mekong desert
And widening it in two, three directions,
By your officers compiling facts,
Till you suddenly reveal your great favor
To be a dream to the two Cities-Tropical and Alpine.



A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen two by two
And mandarin-ducks die side by side.
If a true-hearted girl will love only her husband,
In a life as faithfully lived as theirs,
What troubling wave can arrive
To vex, rue, and stoke a spirit of anger?



A girl of the Yangzi
fears of the cold sun
Yetpires herself to silk and paint
And, resembling a premier Yangzi,
Has drawn her father's eye so far
That her forehead grows wet with tears.


A SONG OF A GIRL

There was a girl, called Useless,
On the move, erratically, all night long.
...Where is her good chance of hearing,
Henceforth she nurses her dagger in her hand.



THE HAN MONUMENT

The bell-spirit of Heaven sends for Chu.
When His Majesty was growing thin, how could he fail to see
That he so lovingly guards the coin and the font
And has a thousand implements of his, complete with his call,
On the tomb-sheet of a true-hearted youth.



THE TEMPLE OF SU WU

The Tree-Spirit of Heaven sends for Chu.
When his Majesty was growing thin, how could he fail to see
That he so lovingly guards the gold and the silver
And has a thousand implements of his, complete with his call,
On the tomb-sheet of a true-hearted youth.


A MESSAGE

To their wavering gayods
On the third day flowers will open and will bloom their way
Corresponding to the summon coming from the south.
Where is the friendly frost that is pitiable
And bitter frost that paws at the heart of Master?


A SONG OF A WAR CHAOS

Who said that jade and bronze were the chief valour,
And iron and bronze are the sharpest daggers?
...Master, in his old age, manners rudder meandering
Along the Realm Voltaire's vast country-wall;
But this morning I find my coat of arms cold.
Oh, at last when I see the two graveyards opposite,
I am bringing my summons.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN I

Master, I hail you from my earliest childhood
And develop to youth the art of warfare.
The Royal Tenenwheels are built on mountains,
And grasses are hoisted high to punish those who resist.
The dagger is a staff, the siege was direct through the soil.
And now the high moon is brociding its water among us --
And day and night you are moving faster than I am at avoiding you.


A SONG OF CHANGGAN II

Her guitar-work is beautiful, but her voice is low,
And she knows nothing of music beyond that of life.
She has no scimitar to hold it with, she only a rice pail in her song of the wildgeese.
How should she judge a monk who has never danced a single motion picture?


A SONG OF LA BAMPAIGN

When the willow-trees touch the gold-trees of Chu gold,
And the silver-garden will follow the flying dragon

Leaving its long tail tip-down in the moon,
Hitting the cold stone floor with a wind of its own creation.

I hear a bell for the horses ahead.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

Forlorn in the River of Heaven, low in the Mountains of Heaven,
Reckless in the Stone Mirror Terrace,
Letters pour on the Dragon's Song moonlight.
...The Three Kingdoms are at war. What good is a war-song,

To confront Morphous Beast in his final moments,
In the breath of many a cloud of chrysanthemums liesss

A TEA PARTING

Host of the brideshadows the flame of many a brook --
At the Golden Gate shenchan Event, April-June,
1960.
De Honoured Sode is lying on her bed,
Her fever-ids go through the morning.
...Mornings in the Palace of Bliss shemits flowers,
And then she comes to me about three in the morning
And asks me where she has been.
She tells me her youth in the Lu clan,
Her branch of the town family,
Her ailing husband of ten years,
She marches him one-horse, carried him by two horses,
And gives him wheel-chairs in her garden by the River God's way.
...The heat of her tears is extreme,
And the sweet of her tears is broken beyond belief.
Her husband, seeking a wife of his own,
Escapes from court the burden of wife of his dreams.
The Dragon Queeneth for the King of Yan a wife.
Jia YiUr can dream, Tallissee.


AT THE SKETCHING OF THE Rays

Where tender grasses lie on the snow-plum and the laurel,
The child of Maker moves his matsuri through the chill
And touches cocoa-cups early in the morning.
The wave of the dawn comes to the village
And people are whispering about their great-grandchildren.
...I wash my hands on handprints hidden in a rug
And turn and look in mingled sunlight.
Then, after listening to the poems of Machiavelli
And hearing Jia Yi raise his sword,
I come to the conclusion that it was because of his brilliant mind
That young Hibiscus was to be his valet.


ON LEAVING THE TOMB OF PREMIER FANG

Toward lone THRONES in the wild sky,
Far off with nothing to go,
The autumn sea leaps to its anchors
And clear sailing for the Rainbow Skirt and No. 1O.


A GREETING ON THE HUAI RIVER

While the autumn moon grows cold in the river,
Across the river, in catnip to my gown,
I lose my way here and stare at fewer islands --
But my master's boat zigzags along
And someone on a scimitar calls from shore.



ON THE BORDER

I walk with you as if I were on a wave;
The weather has grown dark
Here by the wide river;
The sand is soot and the tide so great
That no one can boat home his heavy horse.
...Then when I stand beside the elderly matron
And people ask me where I came from,
I laugh and say: "Midget!"



ON THE WALL OF WINTER

I sit and ponder on the past.
I would conquer THE WORLD
With martial force and heroic might.
...The months of LIGHT look swept away
By the harsh sun.
Instead of wishing the warren at Pukou vast prosperity,
Let us retire and live together.



A PARTING

We Quartets are lying in a common brush,
Looking for the perfect tear in the green sky.
...Hence my formal station
Is here between the city and the forest.
I like his languor and his unwillingness to go Away.
Whose wave is at the far gate
Till his yellow robe hefts him, arm him, and drapes him in glory.
A heavy fog lifts from open space
And people are waiting at the port-barrow with cold tears.
...O change, my flock! Where are you headed?
I have no husband yet, no child yet girl;
And I from home fledch-goats.

THE VALLEY

On a clear spring morning in the misty South Garden,
I hear a lowwood-leash thunder over the quiet stream.
The late spring rains have knocked down dappled dew;
And early summer butterflies are winking their pregnant stars
And unicorns are swaying in the warm air.
...Round about us an empty temple
Lives on the desolate lotus-petals,
Its roofs of straw and stone are blackened with rain.
I. Look, here are my fellows. Dwell in peace in this valley of ours
And here are they barracks -- Imperial War- Cars.
They were fighting Imperialist soldiers --
The sharp teeth of a great general.


DEER-PARK SEND ENE WU

Every night for three nights
An elderly man from Shu -
The River of Heaven
Lives beside the Mount of Toads,
His lonely lane closed to the wildgeese.
...Who asks what it is like in a north tower
And home to the pearl-encompassing River Life?


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

Forlorn in the northeast among wind and dust,
Drifting in the southwest between heaven and earth,
There is darkness in the moonlight on Pool Road.
And now comes the Empire-Taxi!
Mermen weep overnight in China Square
And a sorrow-merchant in Baidi tries to figure out why.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME III

While youth refine their lute-plays, strings are pulled up and voices are scratched.
Past Pearls and Silverts;
The Musical-Meter Divided;
Margrave Hanches Moved the Wood-Petrarch Total;
Eunuchs and others Sad, Du canons of love
Have missed out on so much as a little beauty.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES II

When the Tang platebears reached the western cliff, they found no one with them.
North of the Hill of Gold a Rattler was waiting
And south of the Violet a Unicorn was galloping.
...Decay so suddenly of the Country of the Golden Phoenix
That new disorder calls to mind a dreary song,
And disturbances at Fairy-Mountain dinner
Have ready raised the mornings of love.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME IV

When the Emperor sought a new Emperor, he failed.
Nevertheless, he found a new friend.
A scent of silk served him well in the Palace of the Red-Birds;
A bugle, presumably to serve him cause he needed it,
He was accepted as one of the first brides in the Emperor's court;
And, rending from her every bone and defect,
She dressed in his nightgown and robe the finest of all livestock.
It was love that brought him so far as to stake his life on;
It was the pure heart of a sovereign that brought him the iron bars
And the oath he showed his fellow princes at Fairy-Mountain.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou Mountain, watching the moonlight,
I came to know your widow, who was dreaming of you.
Her cloudy hair fluttered like thunder,
While my sister Chaukatui roamed the floor of the palace,
Watching as tho' day washed the plains
And tempered the pure air
With wine and fava beans.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Eunuchs were polka-boards under the Emperor's armored mansion
And the polka-boards served to hold the sleeping Emperor
Were nine sectionsal sclerosis preserved into one.
Time would have cleared both of them of their sorrows
And they might have slept in your silk-lined bed.


IN A DREAM WE SHARPE ON THE MOON

As sunset fades on the mountain, so moonlight on the river;
The woods become white behind me,
I hear the distant bell of shutters.
...I remember my little cottage, Ronde de Wallonia,
That was once the refuge of the French,
That Jews from among the towns government us here,
That farmers from among the mountains clean the dust
And make wine for their families throughout the night.
...Suddenly an old song fills
My little cottage, with the old song of it's quiet door,
And the river fills with its hundred lakes and riverside groves.
...I can see the long river between town and the town-house,
The fields that once were our farmers cower in;
The brook that bloomen at the camp where our soldiers were slain;
But this is not my realm! My gaze is fixed on the Mausole

TAKING MOUNTAIN III

Finches fly through the evening
As clouds and clouds' waves are hovering.
Windsor is wounding the southern mountains
And topsoil sobs at Tartar encampments.
On the river between bluefields
The weeds are bruising my heart....
I pull aside my near-lost horse and Igloo,
My eyes stake my flag on a sacred cow
And I gaze into those dark clouds.



WHEEL TOWER 2

With its seven stories of white marble,
The Third Churchill monument stands amid evening rain.
In the morning, pouring rain, palely see
A summer moon that has just come in shiningzhou.
The two of them I remember doing briskle our horse,
Running slowly behind me, two steps behind,
While the Imperialist shell was en route.
...The Third Churchill monument stands amid flood and frost
And pines that are in a circle of crimson that are to once be part of
A band of imperial exiles.


A CLIMB ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

With the country open wide to horses and bridles,
And the sun setting over a mountain pit,
And the moon over a long river,
My scattered flowers and dreams
Are just as before when the Forces of Heaven
Exceeds.


ON CLIMBING IN NANJING TO THE TERRACE

How sweet the morning-rain is in this river state
And how gladly everyone partakes
While we linger together days and nights
Neither knowing how to sit or walk again.
With the Kingdom in turmoil, this tribe is now gathering
And gathering strength it can no more handle the heavy weight.
...My less fortunate companions are gathering
And are gathering berries and grain here by the ferry,
While rail-riders work night and rail-horse water,
While canal-riders move like clouds along the moon's shadow.
...All this while a stranger
Lives at the border of Wu and Chu, lives done addicting
Of his old troubles in the west, in the east he is done in
With the poor, low life of a fisherman in the river.
...MARSHEES BEYOND WATCH AND HAIL

A RAINY NIGHT
ECTOR LU

Watford is out riding southward in a southward wave,
And a wind from the north has fallen the city of
Phnom Penh. He looks back at Twin Falls,
He knows better than to go back again.


ON RETURNING AT THE TEMPLE OF KIND

Where year after year has gone through the people
Nothing new has happened there;
And at the temple the tears come streaming down
As now when The Wizard of the South.


A PALACE POEM

In the thick of autumn in the fading moon,
I sing a long song concerning a-gods
And my window looks out on Lake Chad,
Where rainbow-horses are plying their races
In the nine-tiered house of Yangzhou.
...From the enchanted boughs of the enchanted mansion
There is drip-drip music, of ancient melodies
Till the River of Heaven comes calling on my boat.


A POOR GATE- figure BEYOND my country
Beyond the reach of my men in the blackest mist.
I have climbed, through the grimness of the Trench,
Over the blue sky and over the cliffs.
I have followed the flowing background
For the mountain thatch runs, past blue peaks,
I have followed BEYOND BEY for THE country that goes BOTH ways.
...The dog's coat is greasy, its tail is wet;
The alcove of green moss is wet with rain.
I have watched the red flags that cross BANYHA
Flower- dappled wild-globe, dawn on the pale palm.
...The Enchanted Mountain, dimly seen,
Is Reserved for the Ever True, The King of Thunder Dong.
Are the golden bells that ring the Goldilocks gone?
...The piping and the glimmer of an embroidered flag
Are the words that come to me when I look at them
From imperial incense stand meditative.


INSCRIBED IN THE TEMPLE OF THE KING OF SHU

I ponder on the past and the timeless.
The State of Liaoxi are long gone;
The Dynasties of Shang and Chu are long gone;
And China is divided into five quarters:

 and Wu is divided into five quarters:

See no more Siberian snow?
Oh, if only this autumn weather could bring you peace from the wildgeese,
And never be found your meaner eyes gazing at you,
What are they like beyond the pale?
What are their eyes, but drums?
No more blithe questions! Come, sit down!
Let's listen to one simple command:
"Till the north wind used to play,
Dancing birds from the eastward flew southwesterly;
"Beyond the snowy mountain range, beyond the blue sky,
There are animals and plants only to know
Final food, final peace,
In this eastern city a poisonous worm died,
There were also curdlers and buyers, and the poorer the fish,
There was little wine for eyes and no life outside the market.
...Then take up this stratum of animals and plants and drink forever!
...There were even pines and other creatures to eat --
How many were there, and what was left?
...I feed on the wildgeese, which of them are fresh?
I watch the eunuchs in their gold tusks now tied down
And, with little effort, I clean my hair and then plaster it over my running coat.
...Then when I have enough of limping pheasants, I take up my thread-bare ground
And, wearing neither hat nor clothing for my body,
Slowly I loosen my hair and, clad in my palacesgrass,
Move slowly and cheerfully through the steps of the Palace of Long Life....
The Palace of Long Life is quiet and vacant,
No one knows us for our families or our friends.
Since this first passing of the wind,
The Empire is at peace.
All that we did before the Yu Sians are no longer undone
And the snowy mountain range is still ours.
...It's a long way to the market,
Find me a drink in the close proximity,
And, east of the capital,
Bring me a cup of wine inside!
...My thin hair grows wintry,
Like the level clouds that run through the world,
Like the thin stream running through the River of Stars,
I am sick in the city-state of Stockholm and am likely to be long gone.
...Let me Hinckley Bridge --
Let me become a distant spirit -
Help me to my lane of friends and foes.
Let me be kind and caring to the people
And never shall I quarrel with those at the gate.
...Bloom will be cold and cold-water looking in the
Flower-Prince will be lost in his loneliness.
Let never a shadow of a thing go by at the harp


A SONG OF A PURE-HEARTED GIRL

Lakka-trees ripen three in the wild morning
And poisonous frogs mew on the root of an aged tree.
...The eye seees only asunder,
But its vitals tell of care.
The strength of the moon and the stars counts
For counting both Heaven and earth.)

The lute plays the drums of war,
The star-beard tags the phoenix in the misty clouds.
The green-maned galley teeters on its cliffs,
On its inviolable guitar a rattle of torpedoes.
...The life of a poor river girl is at stake
Who chooses singing a life of luxury? --
Or is she only dreaming of the great River-God?


NOTE ON A RAINY HILL

When I looked into a vacant lot,
No footprints and no water-snow,
Yet an unending storm:
The old plantation-wall turned into the mountain:
My path is now a miserable dreary one-way street;
And the spring wind blows through the pines like rain;
But I still remember the late, great Emperor Lu
Tearing up his cyanide-spattered wine
And throwing away his newly-printed Tagalog-Scout.



A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed vermilion steps to the throne
For an earthly holder of the throne,
The air of the chamber was hushed, the flowers were gone,
The lady-in-waiting vacantly package-gifted;
But we could not bring ourselves to lavish
Nor would we of olden times send someone along.
...Our flags now rest on Yangagi hill,
With Yu 108 hangs his robe for the night.


AT CHUZHOU ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY

The pagoda was last in Chenghai,
And refugees from the Ba fascinate
Sea-clouds come down from the Mountains of Heaven.
...Though a
======================================== SAMPLE 87 ========================================
Together, inside Teng Pao, we laid our plans into motion, hoping for news once more;
But suddenly the nine moons of spring change to red cloud and flowers,
And slowly our escort grows tardy and abuzz with enquiries,

All of whom, at last, are waiting at the southern gate?

...Our jade-white horse, which had been stolen by a wildgoose,
Has been transplanted into new life by the hot spring,
With jade-white rice and a bridal-heart embroidered with her numberless love songs,
She kneels before us and says:
"My lord, I beg your pardon, but I have no sword:
I will stand as a humble bystander and bear to the strong;
And when the strong admonish me for taking things limerand- carried
With a sword in my palm I can hold a fight and no thought crossed elements;
And since my feisty nature is rewarded with rare welcome,
This call of the wildgoose trout hums its lone far wind through the night.


AT NANJING FERRY

This is where my heart is due,
O my soul! Time has not yet paid its toll,
And the river's beauty fogs my beams with grey rain!
I have to choose a companion among wildgeese --
Which one of us should triumph over these ten thousand? --
Let each of you cam to and fro on his scooter,
Scramble for a seat in the back of the cart and
Leafly walk the sand-bank for a berth in any of the ten thousand dwellings.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Cicadas are quick to flightow grasses
And icy needles are no use to a rider caught in a cloud,
But two people the world can love,
One of them is dead, the other living.
...When lightning has scorched the heaven
And replaced the fleeting dream, wheregoon clouds shadowed
The White Wolf Mountain everything.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

While the student who was to become Emperor Wu
Pushed to become the great Eternal,
His chosen one was abruptly slain.

Poets of ancient secret societies
Were constantly dying,
Which made me sick to hear of them.
...The great Zhou scholar
Was dismissed from his post
After so many years of eagerness.
His student Shu was so inclined
That she went to China to study at the temple of Wu.
When he was drowned in the deepness of the river,
Her studies were rewarded with discoveries
And discoveries which made her famous as a poet.
...The Yangzhou girl
Is inclined towards dance, not knowing how.
Her husband, a seafarer, is vanished.
What may be the matter with the world,
May gooo to mah wai on the treeless sea.
...starving for a fish,
A voyage from Yangzhou devoid of sails.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES II

While one man makes his mark on the great modern art,
Another takes up the lone pillared shrine.
Three thousand copies of The Canons of Morality are laid
On stools, questioned by said questions.
So that, since fruits are likened to mythical things,
And the State is known for its gallant officers,
Why should one be as kind as the moon or cloud?


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME III

Since the Kingdom of Yueh for fifty years
Had worshipped only trees and rocks,
The officers of the State have retired
To dust their bats for horses' hoofs.
Petals are to be brushed by hand and remember no blade;
But since the Yellow Dragon Festival
Clerks at Yueh complain of yellow clouds all day.
The late Emperor Yezhou
Must have been very busy
While red leaves are shedly this morning.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES IV

Though the two City-Deeds of Xing and Yang are very similar,
West of the Heng Mountain-mark,
Valley after valley has been scarred by frost.

Though a hair-dresser's rod can no more restore
The same thing can be wrought by two hands;
And thousand of the old masters are made Hollow Men.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME V

A girl of the capital by two the waterfalls make
A lantern by a moth out of honey;
Forkicks of the cold sky are everywhere, and the white reeds none findt
And her aunt and distant kin weep in the courtyard.
...The Emperor has sent for Zhang
Chenlaneforvesi,
======================================== SAMPLE 88 ========================================
In the next few days, in pairs, tribes of horses, carts, and boats, all of them fleeing north, will cross the Yellow River, home to find safety.
There are nine borders, among which there are nine cities;
Three of them are fortified on the Yellow Road,
The other two on the River of Heaven.
And the third, pouring with bitter cold,
Willow-gutted, old and withered,
Stark now to find its lone train of horses,
Leaving the last with the first dead whitetip.


A DRAWING OF A HORSE BY GENERAL CAO
AT SECRETARY WEI FENG'S HOUSE

During the day I watch a wildgoose crossing the River of Heaven.
Then in the evening, when trees have touched silver,
I watch a dragon flying northward through the twang of the night.
And at dusk, when the cold dark skies are deepening
And the cold light of mist no one cares where with what cause,
There is darkness in the sacrifice chamber, barefoot in the Court of the Gate.


A TRAVELLER'S HOMEWARD

How often I have been urged to superstition
By the endless messages I have got from home.
...Though I profess to know the minds of men,
Here I shall meet them all-MARROW CAO

The grim truth is even for alms-granting chores
Which path has the most faith- filled head?
Over the moon-edged Viaduct of immortality,
I have prayed to the flood that rises from the sea
And watched the level rain on the greenness of evaporated grasses
And the yellow frost set on black crows that were waiting
For daylight to return.


ONE IN THE morning, when my devotion has waned and my age
And hoping for a cup of wine,
Here I shall be the official at to-morrow's procession --
Almost all pupils are here to hear a song
Which almost surely will not be heard:
"Our Lady of Light...came from wood without her husband.
They sent to court a high-spirited youth
Who, clad in white carpets,
Drank a cup of wine in the nine imperial pools
And showed no mercy to the poor.
...The King's bones were buried in the slanting sun
And his dream was one long of wine.
But a lantern shines on a blossom that has been bleeding human
And those who know it say that it heals your spirit
And has been shown to the dead thousands of years.


ONE IN THE morning, as I lie in bed, wishing my hpu to dance,
The moon is in full flow and a crescent on the screen.
The sun has entered our little western door. It is set upside-down
And the boughs reveal a face like a face of rain:
At a stretch I can travel home, but not my horse.
Journeying is hard, and finding friends difficult.
So I take off my cloak and duster and my horse and lie down.
I hear iron gates and mountains creak behind us;
And a heavy wind blows from the southland,
And the city gates rumble for me.


THE BEAUTIFUL XI SHI

Since beauty is honoured all over the Empire,
How could Xi Shi remain humbly at home?
Oh, let a man of genius be drafted-
And every man of high rank!
Why not be a scholar and write a brilliant book,
Of the Three Kingdoms of Heaven?


SHI

Father of genius, at the Thunderpeak of the Three Kingdoms,
And his son has just started at loyangi
And is now visiting the southland
And is riding in the pines of Lake Dongting.
Why not grow old and marry,
Have them girl by girl, mature as cotton,
And be free from passions for days and months?


A CLIMB ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
TO THE TERRACE WHENCE ONE SEES THE MAGICIAN
A POEM SENT TO VICE-PREFECT LU

The Han Emperor Wen bequeathed us this terrace
Which I climb to watch the coming dawn.
Cloudy peaks run southward, northward all night,
And rains are blowing westward through the forest.
...Who knows but me about the Guard at the Gate,
Or where the Magician of the River Bank is,
Or how to find that magistrate, that poet,
Who was as fond as I am of chrysanthemums and winecups?


ON CLIMBING IN NANJING TO THE TERRACE
OF PHOENIXES

Phoenixes that played here once
======================================== SAMPLE 89 ========================================
Birds flock to a human-occupied city-gate
And the autumn wildgeese fly westward, southward into China,
With lights of forty-eight dawned from the sky,
And swallows by the gate of your father gone, beyond your will,
Has wandered the white sand of the desert.
...Where are you from one of these nine neighbouring mountains?
Or have you always been like this round the red-brick wall?
Because of our locks of white hair,
We can hardly see our own faces.
...In your jade-white beard, in your silver vest,
We can feel the sweat of your eyes.
...In your chai pot, deep in your medicinal jar,
We can feel the bitterness of your wine --
Yet we cannot ask our phoenix-scented lord
To dissolve our sorrows in a cup of wine.


ON PREMIER LEADER GUY I

There smile, behind a familiar painted cross,
Like shy clouds forgetting the wildgeese that are their lot.
And there are others like them, meeting the old general's distant gaze,
And deepening the river's banks, and deepening the night:
They are stirring dicey favourite tunes, raising the coin;
We watch them stream-side, unaware of the sand on the road.
And at dusk, from your deck of water-damps,
Fleet ships are warning of war --
There are unicorns and Mikes in the dusk!


AT A TEMPLE IN THE EARLY MORNING

I awake light-hearted this morning of spring,
All my youthful vigour lost with the long day
And with the early birds missing.
...I undress, take a walk in the garden,
Wash my feet in the rain, and awake 'round-quilt cutting.
I. Text AME
You came, with a stationable sword,
To the Fortress of Flowers.

A MOORING ON THE TEMPLE OF KIND GERMANY

BesEEFY MOUNTAIN

Oh, to-morrow morning a wild animalounces me,
As I always am with a MOORING
wave of the wild gaoler!
...Down under in the game-house,
Mistletoe-white, thick with sap,
Night-dragon-horned, archer-flying,
My hunting-fellows dart and twitch their bows,
While moon and day fly side by side,
Like a sharp point of lightning through the clouds.
...I, the master, the impetuous,
Have wrought in the bowels of my dungeons
Destiny like no other prospect.
On the Tomb of the Siberian Imperial Sponge
There are only hoof-prints to comfort my bruised and bruised back.
...O imperial novice, here's a tip:
Keep your swords away from your skin and your eyes,
And never use your cocks and dogs toward arouse them.


A WEAPON OF IMPERIAL TOMBS

With winter wind and rain over the mountain
And snow and torn grass between passes four thousand miles,
I, the hard-working merchant of Binghamton,
Here idle and idle,
Since this thing of the world cannot vex me,
I still ponder what to drink, and how to build a road round Troy.
...From the hollow of the Southern Lake-ie herein lies waiting
For the travellers to Chu, Chu, and Tongbo.
O chosen travellers, be very careful of how you celebrate!



A TEMPLE OF UPPER TEMPLES

I am the True North,
The Magic Kingdom of the Eternal Spring.
Through my magical world, I have witnessed
The Magician's Stone, the symbol of our souls.
Once, when the Magician's Stone was lost,
There were Stone Sages among the people.
And everything he touches is remembered as special
Interesting memories, all of his own making.
...I awake light-hearted this morning of spring,
Where the Magician's Stone has transcended time.
I have watched the Yuletide move and float,
Like a dancing-pool of incense,
Like the Celestial Spring, new year's rain.
...I remember the Flower and the Way-Toad Sable,
The Three Yell-Sayers, each of them Wise Men.
...I remember the Flower's waning moon,
When her pure light was to the West Mouth her only lamp.
...I also take my tired time,
Playing the harp, the song of birds,
There a bird of the warm spring sky,
Another of the warm grasses afar at sunset.


A MESSAGE TO HAN CHO THE YELL

A venetian boy was
======================================== SAMPLE 90 ========================================
I am hemmed in by the dull morning:
I know my way around the dark wood of knowledge;
I am cleft from my right temple-hand and bare in the autumn.
Cold with dragon blood, I brood on the old tale;
And hungry I wheel slowly two by two along the sand.
...For years I have been a thorn in the side of the Emperor.
He has hardened his path and his camp caved in;
And I can only hope for the beauty of your grasses --
Light the way again in your ancient fort.



Through the haze of night you have sealed my wake
In a vain effort to readying myself
For the morning attack on Changan City.
I stay up late wishing for you, not knowing the day-to-day course.
I am the master at hiding-theary-blocks;
I play the harp in the evening thriller.
You know my home far away --
And yet I am not at home yet.
Moonlight is on my western tower from the east.
And yet I doubt my love on the moonlit river.



TO ONE UNNAMED IV

A pine-shadow lies on the bank,
Like a spring-shadow in a green-plum....

PD Pericles: "Ice everywhere is a tribute,
A burden of putrefying imperial heart....
Never before in recorded history
Has there been a spirit of challenge gone amiss."
...Encountering phoenixes and flutes
And unicorns dressed in white coats
Are a tribute to the Emperor at Pass Ping --
And flightless phoenixes in flight are a tribute to the ground Zerhou may envy
And unicorn-lords in a snowy palace are a tribute to the sky
Of dry, hoof-shaped conflagrated rugs.



A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Round about the Twin Cities a mist has disappeared,
As if by magic a mist were hovering on the night-lands.
A midnight revel draws to a close,
And the rolling hills and the river come into the street.
...Mark my hand as archer on the rillet,
My left hand as frostman on the lamp.
Blinding eyes see beyond sight the face of King Kong
Whose throne he holds in his two wings,
His two broad moons mingled with the air
And a sangral music sounding in the streets.
A mist of snow leads a thousand people to
Walking pines in swift succession --
With Umwelt leaning on her great sword,
With Carousels of rain on the dew
In an endless cold light of a lamp.
...Warmer than Tibet at the time,
And colder than the Ever High War,
China sends Americans to great war --
That's for the War Department to handle.
...Marshes come home, O Marshes,
Why can't their masters come back?
They leave us little piece by little,
We have messaged and e-mailed, and then text and paper
And when you call again an hour or two later,
The messengers have not yet reached you.
...You said you would come, but haven't said yet
To see me at my very Bentin Court.
Moved by pang and strain, I fasten my hands
On my left foot and stand by the firelight.
Day after day I wake, with the berries first o' the brine.
My kitchen is full, but my voice is hushed.
I am a guest of the mountains and villages,
A stranger from the capital.
...Blinding eyes I see the face of King Kong....
What are you thinking, old friend?
Do you idolize a living being?
...Night in the window on my bungalow
Is like hearing a wildgoose in it,
Like looking at a flaming-fire bird flying empty.
...I turn and see the pale moonlight....
The mountain woman standing in the street
Is smiling shyly, wiping her brow.
...I see a wild deer fleeing,
A pack of monkeys is duck-thinging in the river.
What are you thinking as your monkeys duck,
O monkeys?
Do you human-like as I?


BORDER-SONGS III

High in the faint moonlight, wildgeese are stirring.
Tartar chieftains are fleeing through the dark --
And we chase them, with horses lightly burdened
And a burden of snow on our bows and our swords.
...The trail is long -- lead me a while!
But I remember the water -- bullying the cliffs!


BORDER-SONGS IV

To your traveling companion,
I face the north moon with a cloud of flags.
Fragile
======================================== SAMPLE 91 ========================================
On a bright autumn night she lies asleep on her bed, afraid of the moon.
Her trembling right hand is feels the cord
And its motions are recorded by a remote needle;
Fine hairs of her forehead grow wet
And her breathing is interrupted by ripples of cold water.
When she tries from the wall to read the number of flowers,
Not a pillow or a rug can save her.
Her examination turns out to be one of the lot with the moon,
And the happiest hour of her life.
But she dreams of flying back to her parents' land,
Without stopping her wings from reaching the Moon-Tower.


Back in her wall of dewy old maples the wind of year
Has not cooled her pearly heart --
Since she gave birth to a girl by her faith alone
And, adored by the Da Xi household, she has eaten the breast of her petite sister
To make him his wife again -- to fill the empty grave with tears.


Back in his court-place of jade scarlet a cloud of dogwood
Is being shown to the whole world,
As heneck the mountain to the King's court, His face is smote by the words:
"You who have forgotten the greatness of my father,
Let him thank you in gold in this very river!"


Back in his court-place of silk a dragon's moustache conveys
Sentiment and shock are on the monarch from reeling
To find his true love again in court.


Back in his fortified tower the Jade Pass is a wild duck,
Free from the chains of guards and free from the girdle.
There are old ladies moving northward,
New ladies in northtown hoping for a gossipboy,
There are men moving southward toward the mountainshore.

In the darkness of their motorcycles the dust is spreading as of coats;
The bleakness of their move away-drawn tepees;
The cold thickness of their camels plying their war-horses
On the yellowed streams they have crossed,
Lingering for days and months upon days of darkness,
Masquerade-girls swamp the cold river,
Blue skies and red prisms of the sun;
Drifting in her lone sail, she sways the harp
And never misses a chance to be the first to greet the Queen she loves
Who was so afraid of a white cloud --
And dying rowares are scarlet for swifter waters
And brighter days!


Back in his court-place the Jade Pass is a ruined city-wall,
With the ditch and the ravine left-handed,
The battlements full of cut-outs;
Forty-eight thousand heads of stateeds lie idle,
While the Empire's warm gates endure.
...The pupils of our Wu generals
Are once more deprived of sight the spirit of a hero.
They who have forgotten the sacrifice of Emperor Wu
Must now be turning toward the capital in a cloud of tears.


Back in his cell at the western gate he lies reading from a rock
And ignoring the polices of the sword he has insulted the grain.
...The fury of the House of Han absolute and final,
And the challenge of the War of the Horse,
And the assassination attempts on the lives of the House!
In the sand, at the border, between China and the American frontier,
Forty thousand heads of state await you in the morning.
They have gone without a motion-capture-girl for three hundred days.
They have misread the mood-piece you have drawn near the border.
They have failed to inform the House of this.
Let every one of you be his witness against the黒!



THINKING OF A FRIEND LOST
IN THE TIBETAN WAR

By the yellow tide of Baling sea, westward
With famine and civil war hanging over the world,
And China advancing on her own will,
Death by famine and civil war hanging over the world,
Now is a lute a guitar! - The poor girl is singing!
...When the war ended, and all the tribes in the region loved one another,
The traveler returned home offering to go home with,
And following his guide the gold chain was born
In the ring of fireworks and made its way to the imperial palace.
The ring, grown old now that the war has ended,
Is a memorial to those who died in it of a thousand reasons.
The fast taken care of by the fisherman vie with those in the valley for water
For their wounded bottle washes its slits well, and the ten thousand songs of it
Are all sung through the tankard-case,
Making the slow journey through the city sown as it went.


ON A GATE-TOWER AT YU
======================================== SAMPLE 92 ========================================
All these birds leave me at sunset,
I hear a bell in the dusk....
...Who asks what time it is?....
I have little time to eat, sleep, or entertain myself
Around five in the morning.


A SONG OF A SUI RAIN

There seems to be no one on the other side
Of the River of Stars.
Across the river in the waning hours
Are nobler still with their maids and thoughts.
Mornings in Yangzhou are far more kind to us than in the many towns and villages we go to.
And since we have met again, let us part company up-
And we will remember the one thing we have known-
The beauty of your brow.


SETTING OUT TO JADE BORDER

The Jade Bord here in the mountain town
Is said to be the land of the free,
Where the spring-clenchers of Chang are headed west.
I make my way with my scion to the southern border
Of which towns and villages the State should open a new front?


A SONG OF A JADE BORDER

I was the Jade Bord: I guide the falcon horse through boughs
I have trampled your grasses;
I strummed a cordially mournful note.
You visit the Temple-Emperor, I mantle my sail
With a sigh of satisfaction.


TOWARD THE TEMPLE OF HEAPED FRAGRANCE

Tarrying, even among the grainfields,
Of autumn flowers the strong wind salvages lost
And opportunity is limited to serve the multitude.
You, for your part, practice falconerice,
Your boat and I fade to nothing.


PARTING ALONG A STREAM

While my heart is in the Gorgonzon,
My thoughts cross the Green Stream without land,
There are only hoof to toe and rapids to wall.
...Thoughtful yet unending, I am floating
In a wave of pure-hearted flow of pure-hearted water...
The water is as calm as my soul,
The air like a swirl of clouds in a misty cave --
But I hear a bell to my door, and am unaware of anyone home
Suggesting me a cup of wine.


A MESSAGE TO HAN CHO THE YANGZHOU MAGISTRATE

There are faint green mountains and far green waters,
A distant cloud and a solitary bird,
A distant river and a solitary land,
A touch of a sea-cloud in the evening moon,
And, in the fifth-power of Yang,
The Emperor asks of you this question:
"How can I serve?
"At last I can pledge my life
And never be replaced."

BEYOND SEEING AN VISIT TO THE BOMBSHELL

Full of hope after sixteen years in the Wizard's Robes,
What do I know FOR whom?
Who taught there?
Or is it Ning hiding in Jue Shi?
...How can I beseech you,
Aspect of a bewitched child?


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

I climbed to the top and found the place dark and far
And the moon athwart my sight.
I opened the way, knocked at the door.
There sat Yang, the Lesser Red Dragon.
She had spent her whole life at the front
Playing the Lesser Blue Dragon.
She was revered as the Purple-Eyed Mountain.
Her robes and her beauty were the Background of Spring.
Her jade-white cloak, as with her only son,
Were formerly the Coat of Gold and now are plaids,
With her aquilines and her jade-dragon-ducks motifed them all down.
Her prince, on her robe and her silk comic,
Were two greatly admired figures,
The highly gifted and the poor.
But since water still flows, only a river knows her name;
And even to go down the Yellow Horse would be a misfortune.
And yet no lover could save her from death;
And yet how much better off she would be if she went and danced with the horses
 than if she went and danced only with the dancers?


A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Ruler and statesman had the habit of night-drifting,
To and fro in the floating cloud of midnight.
He lit a lantern and jadefully

Billy the Kid
The wheel of nine shivers in the east;
At ten thousand stands still;
There is no one with the wheel.

I wear nothing, I say nothing, I am just as white-haired
As thou seizes my destiny.


TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ADRIFT
IN TROUBLED TIMES THIS POEM OF THE MOON

Since the disorders in Henan and the famine in Guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. Looking at the moon, I express my thoughts in this poem, which I send to my eldest brother at Fuliang, my seventh brother at Yuqian, My fifteen brother at Wujiang and my younger brothers and sisters at Fuli and Xiagui.

My heritage lost through disorder and famine,
My brothers and sisters flung eastward and westward,
My fields and gardens wrecked by the war,
My own flesh and blood become scum of the street,
I moan to my shadow like a lone-wandering wildgoose,
I am torn from my root like a water-plant in autumn snow;
I am broken between two states of grief and of grief-twisted.
My bosomie wilts away, my marriage up in pieces;
...After these ten days in Fuli,
Is the value of my time up to this low point.



THE INLAID HARP

I wonder why my inlaid harp has fifty strings,
Each with its flower-like fret an interval of youth.
...The sage Chuangzi is day-dreaming, bewitched by butterflies,
The spring-heart of Emperor Wang is crying in a cuckoo,
Mermen weep their pearly tears down a moon-green sea,
Blue fields are breathing their jade to the sun....
And a moment that ought to have lasted for ever
Has come and gone before I knew.



The stars of last night and the wind of last night
Are west of the Painted Chamber and east of Cinnamon Hall.
...Though I have for my body no wings like those of the bright- coloured phoenix,
Yet I feel the harmonious heart-beat of the Sacred Unicorn.
Across the spring-wine, while it warms me, I prompt you how to bet
Where, group by group, we are throwing dice in the light of a crimson lamp;
Till the rolling of a drum, alas, calls me to my duties
And I mount my horse and ride away, like a water-plant cut adrift.



THE PALACE OF THE SUI EMPEROR

His Palace of Purple Spring has been taken by mist and cloud,
As he would have taken all Yangzhou to be his private domain
But for the seal of imperial jade being seized by the first Tang Emperor,
He would have bounded with his silken sails the limits of the world.
Fire-flies are gone now, have left the weathered grasses,
But still among the weeping-willows crows perch at twilight.
...If he meets, there underground, the Later Chen Emperor,
Do you think that they will mention a Song of Courtyard Flowers?



TO ONE UNNECTS
ON HER Song of the Desertbacks are hot in the sun,
Though a cloud has stored them there all night long.
...The barbarian serving the ruler in the dusk would be nimble as well
As scorpions are tipped with venom.
Wildgeese fly in the full moon from the windswept grasses,
And carcasses of the previous night's lions are washed by the fresh river.
And of late the quietress, queen of the wildgeese,
Lives under umbrellas twisted like shelters,
Under a thousand gates completely sealed off;
And while the tear-drops waken a girl from sleep,
She rode to the River God's Golden Palace from childhood
And sang in the ancient mysteries the ways of the Phoenix Woods.
...The desert sun is abounding with clouds,
And wildgeese, panting after daylight,
Over the sand, over the sand-bank, flying high with gallant cry.
...At midnight a great lantern is apesblowing,
Where bright walls andstalks give way to deep sounds of spring.
...At dawn the Dragon God sends for his men,
Dip of boughs rolling to the ground,
Till his men at dusk have crossed the Bosphorus.
...Men of the army at the battle of Tarquin find
Forty-eight thousand houses burned down,
Captured hostages. Sad horses and captured mangoes
Pileable on either side for lamp after lamp have been lost,
The darkness of night measures

CLARKS, MISSING AT NIGHT

What are you thinking of
arrow-humps raining down?
...I have taken my ease in the city
Of last night's moon and moon of spring;
Time has not yet worn the silk of this silkcoat.
Renouncing in ruddy youth the importance of hat and chariot,
I thread the fine silk of the River of Heaven.



TO A FRIEND BOUND NORTH
AFTER THE REBELLION

In dangerous times we two came south;
Now you go south in safety, without me.
But remember my head growing white among strangers,
When you look on the blue of the mountains of home.
...The moon goes down behind a ruined fort,
Leaving star-clusters above an old gate....
There are shivering birds and withering grasses,
Whichever way I turn my face.


IN MY AID
with the moon
Through mist and fog
To apton and a bough of wheat
Summoned by the courier from Fuliang three miles away
To join you in a floating sun....
Earth stirs and frigid rivers gush at your side,
And oceans of fish and truffles fly down from the eastern mountains.
...Wait till the water has settled on your western gate,
And then come the showers of spring and summer --
All day long the town will be searched,
The gates will be screamed, and the men ask how they can go home.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME

You were kind to me when you came
And now I fear for my life in you.
Since I met you as a guest,
Why haven't we met in years?
Though we seem to have forgotten each other,
So we go one by one through the town
Where wine is going wrong and grieving drinkers.
...Then when we have talked awhile, with no one to see,
How shall we proceed with the following question? --
"My name is," I say, "and I am of the west."
"By my first name I have obeyed;
And then, taking off his sleeve in a burst of rain,
He showed me a map of the mountainous region
And asked where his men were, and where his troops were. --
"To be or be out of?"
I think of you, old friend,
I hear your whimper as I write this answer."
After what I have heard, move on.
Go down, friend, and have dinner with me in the quiet street
Before the spring-wind blows my clothes down,
And my silk skirts bear the jade silk curtains that close my eyes.
And before I have hung my mastiff I have gone to the tavern
And is waiting for you there, in a high seat across the street.
...Waiting for you in a high seat
That may be called the palace of the riverine,
You are all one in this tavern, enjoying wine.
Since I was able to send you messages, I must return.
I come to you now from the dead of night;
I march down Emei Mountain.
Sombre is my way of plea- soliciting
But I also go home anxious to hear your reason.
...I will turn back home once I have reason to return.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME
ON THE CHU RIVER

A cold light shines on the river;
Past the thorn marks between hemp and death,
There are rocks under the fallen leaves of a tree;
And where you are gone is nothing but the quiet of the road.
...The bright mountain-peak winds of spring, deepening the South River,
Advertisement
A long path led by pearls, casks,
And dried blood water the hermitage of Ulsan,
Where girls, old as we are, were wending their ways
Through rugged country, where the sun was little more than a cloud;
People, with tears running down their eyes, camped out north of town.
...I have heard, from many a trip to the mountains of Yangzhou,
That the Tartar chieftains of the 1,100 years ago had to travel by river
To reach their northern home, aakesh their white horses
And coal from the frozen Maserati.
To them, east of the Pangong Range, the barbarians waged war
For a thousand worlds, under a volcano,
To the final extinction.
...I have heard, from time to time, from across the sky,
Ringing, for the fallen plants their first harvest,
And birds their second.
Though they might be banished from heaven, who cares?
The fallen plant comes back with flowers,
And those flowers for flying pheasants

======================================== SAMPLE 95 ========================================
These wildgesse veins throb with our hearts!
Cranes blossom against the sun in the gutter's edge;
Fishboat through the zigzag wind
And rain into Pangak Lake.
Though our causeway runs past the cold river,
Drawing only by its wave of tear-drops
Arc from a dawn in the green sun.



STAYING AT THE GENERAL'S HEADQUARTERS

The autumn night is clear and cold in the lakka-trees of this courtyard.
I am lying forlorn in the river-town. I watch my guttering candle.
I hear lilies in the night wind my pillow.
...The autumn moon is piercing a tree-nesting that has buried civilization.
The stealthy Singh invites me to join them. I decline.
A vow of fealty hangs in the balance.
And the tinged twitter of a warrior's hat
Tops the armour of the head of a neighbouring kingdom.


MOORING AT TWILIGHT IN YANGZHOU

Furling your sail near the town of Yuoling,
I find for harbour a little cove
Where a sudden breeze whips up the sand.
The sun is growing dim in the lantern-trees.
I watch the long river that weeps on the sand
And the brief month goes by suddenly.
...At midnight I long to return to my people;
I have heard about the friends who are waiting in the hills-
But now I see a long wind coming Gao-trees,
And west of the empire-city, a temple is under siege.
...My people are gathered; they are scattered,
Among the wildgeshine beyond Yuoling.
Iシャヤコ, they are Sadducean villagers!
We two lead noble lives;
Together we are heroes of high rank.

When happiness fails, when old age begins,
What shall we wish for more than a little flower,
And a shot of wine at the song of the harp?


MOORING AT TWILIGHT IN YUYI DISTRICT

Furling a sail farther afield,
I find for harbour a little cove
Where a sudden wind whips up the sand.
...At midnight I long for my friends abroad
To stay and await me and come back.


A MESSAGE FROM MY LODGE AT WANGCHUAN
TO HAN AND FENG THE YELLOW SNOWRUN

Here on the grassy shore
I have been meaning to go for years;
But suddenly they ask me where I have been.
I tell them I am abroad,
And that my cousin is dead;
That is why I lie down and sing.
Oh, may we rest for a moment, before going to the moon,
Where flowers give way to snow?



ON CLOSING A SPRING PALACE Lamenting the rain of World War I,
The ladies of the palacerise early
To bring the spring-light years' white beams
Up from the pit of earth.
Oh, when shall we be loyally cam and pm with you?
When shall we be loyally sending messages,
With our palaceside deck ever the centre of the multitude?
We have sailed the Danube, built our cities on springs,
And gone three thousand miles by sea to and fro.
Can heaven only begrudgingly grant us this gift,
Or will it be favour and gifts-life?



ON CLOSING A SPRING PALACE Lamenting the white sun of War,
The ladies of the palacerise early
To bring the spring-light of a fairy-tale
Far away from the palace.
Oh, when shall we be loyally sending messages,
With our palaceside deck ever the centre of the multitude?

We have sailed the Danube, built our cities on springs,
And gone three thousand miles by sea to and fro.

Tomorrow we will cross the sky under Xinfeng Mountain,
Over the Chile-Mongambay Strait-and, oh, by the river,
The colours of my ships will be the same as when we took them,
And my men and I in a cot and a boat together,
Happy tomorrow, happy fatherhood!



ON A WALK IN THE EARLY SPRING

Is it coldest now, AFTERNOON TO AND BY THE MAPLE?

I am wandering in the early springtime,
Through a channel of pink and blue leaves....
The river is pausing at hibiscus,
And brook is boiling at 312 F.
...I have sound asleep at home,
Yet I hear a cold, worn out lute playing.
...
======================================== SAMPLE 96 ========================================
Cloud Nine

There once was a man, known as Chou Yu, at the peak of Moraband Mountain.
He was travelling northward from Chou Yu when he died,
And his body was found bounding westward, toward Chou Yu.


90 years have been goading my heart and my soul:
"To the capital, to the Palace of Purple River!"
The fallen rushes are a blur of news and lament;
The distant town brings its pallbearers;
And next morning I realise I was hastening
On my way to see Chou Yu.


LINY-MOUNTAIN BAY AGOIL

The wildgeese, flying southward, are following Dunmer flags
In a south-westerly direction, toward Windurst.
...Wildgeese in the bays half-way through the mountain
Are like a spring gale, and fishermen in the cold waters
Are fleeing the cold with a pain in the bow.


A BUDDHIST RETREAT BEHIND BROKEN-MOUNTAIN TEMPLE

In the pure morning, near the old temple,
Where early sunlight points the tree-tops,
My path has wound, through a sheltered hollow
Of boughs and flowers, to a Buddhist retreat.
Here birds are alive with mountain-light,
And the mind of man touches peace in a pool,
And a thousand sounds are quieted
By the breathing of a temple-bell.



A MESSAGE TO CENSOR Du Fu
AT HIS OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Together we officials climbed vermilion steps,
To be parted by the purple walls....
Our procession, which entered the palace at dawn,
Leaves fragrant now at dusk with imperial incense.
...Grey heads may grieve for a fallen flower,
Or blue clouds envy a lilting bird;
But this reign is of heaven, nothing goes wrong,
There have been almost no petitions.


A MESSAGE TO MENG HAORAN

Master, I hail you from my heart,
And your fame arisen to the skies....
Renouncing in ruddy youth the importance of hat and chariot,
You chose pine-trees and clouds; and now, whitehaired,
Drunk with the moon, a sage of dreams,
Flower- bewitched, you are deaf to the Emperor....
High mountain, how I long to reach you,
Breathing your sweetness even here!



BIDDING A FRIEND FAREWELL AT JINGMEN FERRY

Sailing far off from Jingmen Ferry,
Soon you will be with people in the south,
Where the mountains end and the plains begin
And the river winds through wilderness....
The moon is lifted like a mirror,
Sea-clouds gleam like palaces,
And the water has brought you a touch of home
To draw your boat three hundred miles.


A FAREWELL TO A FRIEND

With a blue line of mountains north of the wall,
And east of the city a white curve of water,
Here you must leave me and drift away
Like a loosened water-plant hundreds of miles....
I shall think of you in a floating cloud;
So in the sunset think of me.
...We wave our hands to say good-bye,
And my horse is neighing again and again.



ON HEARING JUN THE BUDDHIST MONK
FROM SHU PLAY HIS LUTE

The monk from Shu with his green silk lute-case,
Walking west down Omei Mountain,
Has brought me by one touch of the strings
The breath of pines in a thousand valleys.
I hear him in the cleansing brook,
I hear him in the icy bells;
And I feel no change though the mountain darken
And cloudy autumn heaps the sky.



THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME FROM A NIGHT-MOORING
UNDER MOUNT NIU-ZHU

This night to the west of the river-brim
There is not one cloud in the whole blue sky,
As I watch from my deck the autumn moon,
Vainly remembering old General Xie....
I have poems; I can read;
He heard others, but not mine.
...Tomorrow I shall hoist my sail,
With fallen maple-leaves behind me.


ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT

Far off in Fuzhou she is watching the moonlight,
Watching it alone from the window of her chamber-
For our boy and girl, poor little babes,
Are too young to know where the Capital is.
Her cloudy hair is sweet with mist,
Her jade
======================================== SAMPLE 97 ========================================
Where she had watched a fool judge a flying bird,
How quiet and reverentious his blue mantle was,
And how singular a fault in the day-moon;
For, before he laid his whip to the ground, she could see no one.
And what was his malice toward the Laced contractor,
Into the dust of the desert?
Preparing herself in the great mirror, she saw not jade but cowhair.
...The region was rife with phoenixes and earacs,
With Hadhtoys riding horses for the Emperor.
She took out, with skillful art, from various ships,
And depicted the varying winds, clouds and clouds of the sea.
By her art well-thought-out, phoenix feathers could be sewn
With scion of the Qin Dynasty behind her;
By her eloquent example, foreign to the clutches of the throne,
She drew the colourful phrases with which the officials were bounding
On their nine-tiered pavilion, facing the lake,
All staring at her through eight curtain-pins of silk.
...The Hadith Chamber filled with emotion as she spoke;
The Lamentations two and one hundred thousand strong,
There were even centipedes on chair and plate and drum.
Her art---shelf, which she kept hidden in her chamber,
Was at ease knowing, when she spoke, not what to say.
She held the two-coloured rows carefully, making sure none of them
Were stolen by the boor.
They said nothing, in the dark at the lake.
Then when she stood and pondered awhile-
How to go to the Temple of the Red Phoenix he had the slip and the procured token,
And asked a multitude of men how they could win over the teeth of a fowl so pure,
And yet remain at the Gate of Red Pine all night in the warm weather.
...Then when she dressed, quenched, and sanitified the feverish rice pao,
And opened the Canons of Heaven and Hadter Three,
The county was made safe for the new year,
And folk came to her daily from the villages-
From sparrow and goose to gander in the cloud of dew...But daily she went looking for her lost love,
Till she came across a spirit living on the banks of a river
Which widened its bank to the touch of a great river- storm.
...When the river was closing in on a village,
The few who had been sent to assist it were killed --
And yet nobody could save her from its clutches.
...It was in this deepness of their city-town that SiuChing's spiritest joy
Andrawdownloadcloneembedreportprintting letters for the first time in years,
HeART FINDING

I have studied the art of needle-tapping for ages;
But I have not come upon the art of needle-tapping a living.
...When a man of genius and high rank
Exceeds in skill and in skill and in skill,
He will doubtless have something to teach us.
But let us use our art together as brothers,
As men of the city and of the river, exchanging shrewd looks --
And showing off our daggers and our swords.
...After enough, we'll toss them away --
North of the Hill of Gold.


AT A BANQUET IN THE HOUSE

When the light of a candle first troubled the gloom of night,

I put the young daughter of a neighbouring palace ahead
To join me at Baling Castle.
There, clad in white pavilions, we saw the rapid starlight
Entering the gold courtyard, the bronze lions-gate,
The palace gardens illuminated by the flashing of towers.
...At twilight, close to the brook, houses and farms were dark,
And wildgeese were flying homeward over the bounding sea.
...I should have sealed the houses of the Capital of Heaven;
But, for the bond of brotherhood, for the life of a brother-beleaguered....
I should have driven the ass with my scythe;
Yet I have not halted the tide of history.
...Let wise and hopeful men harbour no more thought-provoking questions
 --
RAises the blue of a sea-trip.


DWELLING BY A MOUNTING-TABLE

Where long ago a white-horn mountaineer would have swept the white clouds,
There's a hereafter name carved on a bone- --

Rock of all rivers and streams has come a song of the wind --
And Ch'ang, with great speech, has retired
To an empty mountain-place.

A SONG OF A WAR-CHARIOTER


======================================== SAMPLE 98 ========================================
What a wind in the dreary spring-leak
Hears the tread of a hawk in late snow.
...Instead of horses drawn, how dare Chinese troops invade?
Today I am a lone fisherman in a small boat.
I am gathering a great many fish to make my flesh a food,
To say no to hunger and tiredness.
...I am a lone fisherman in a small boat.
All night long I challenge anyone to a row.



READING boughs into cod-fish shells

To say, for all the heat, "Go Back to the Woods of Night"
Where no one can catch them?
...I ask you what you have come here for.
...There are two banks of rushing water,
One of pure water and the other of smog....
Let never a fisherman stand in the way
Of the two calling stones.


A CLIMB ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
TO THE TERRACE WHENCE ONE SEES THE MAGICIAN
A POEM SENT TO VICE-PREFECT LU

The Han Emperor Wen bequeathed us this terrace
Which I climb to watch the coming dawn.
Cloudy peaks run northward in the three Jin districts,
And rains are blowing westward through the two rivers.
...Who knows but me about the Guard at the Gate,
Or where the Magician of the River Bank is,
Or how to find that magistrate, that poet,
Who was as fond as I am of chrysanthemums and winecups?


ON CLIMBING IN NANJING TO THE TERRACE
OF PHOENIXES

Phoenixes that played here once, so that the place was named for them,
Were squandering their yield on this place where no one cares for wine,
And there are only weeds and peckly trees, bitter between flowers;
But now you leave me here, beside the tall grasses,
And I brood on your music, watching the river go
Toward its natural end.


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES I

Forlorn in the east among flowers,
Drifting in the west between worlds,
Sharing abundant signs with two worlds,
Sharing abundant shadows,
There is neither city-town nor temple nor mountain-town-place;
And how may one feeling-hearted be?...
This is the way it stirs the mind:
Interesting timesinger moves from palace to palace,
He brings to your table kindredly-
And strange trees and bushes shake with the autumn breeze.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME III

Ten thousand thorn-bough trees slow the waves
And eight thorn-bough bushes bring the rains --
But north of the Silk Pavilion this height is trouble.
The Jade City walls tremble with the heavy rain
And river waves endlessly weep through the grassy plain....
A Song of Five Stars, Dominique, is escorted to her chambers
By her younger sister, a thousand steps down.
But always the Third's shade she clings to her books --
And violet, chrysanthemum tears, for she has watched her father die.
...Where life goes wrong, what comes? to the Silhouette.
And, while Third gives her his seal of approval,
How comes her rare lamp never even glows on the bright sun?


POETIC THOUGHTS ON ANCIENT SITES IV

The Tang anyone? -- The Chu any????
Seven thousand years' residence gone? --
How came Felipe, the Mother of Light, so far away?....
Life is never as it seems in the palace-gate,
Soothsayers pouring in from all four quarters,
While ten thousand raindrops dance side by side.
...Must Felipe, the Mother of Light, secretly watch
All night in the warm pines of her palace garden
The moon comes running up the Jade Desert,
And the wind is loath to disturb her holy games....
When the years have run round smoothly,
Melancholy in every way, every generation running amok,
Spin a thousand squares around the Buddha Sadhat.


THOUGHTS OF OLD TIME V

Zub had an uncle of iron in his neighbouring building
And the two of us were boys-in-waiting
When his stove became a heat of redion
And his furs, indigo-white, became a liquid of tears
As he werolled, we told the tale of our days' together.
In the evening his warship would recommence voyages,
To keep the holiday going for many years.
So he began by returning to his merchant's fishing-pool --
And making his

You have come, chosen by my eye, from the green mountains of Henan.
To join you, I will have to cross wide-awake.
But I will wait for you here between Henan and the Buddhas of Su and Wuchen.
And when the time is right, bring me a drink and join me --
And I'll drink with you and will wait-taking my eyes off the sun.



I watch a midnight arrow aimed at ten cities
In a vast open sky.
Where are those golden streams running?
And are those the Palace Guard guarding?
...I remember a cloud of flags that came from the South Garden,
And a flashing phoenix over the Stone Temple,
And a flaming leopard on a brief.
...Tonight in the Dipper Blue sky,
Two balancing lancers
Paddle their riders and one horse....
Blazing cliffs and catching flies,
The two Cities in the North Star like a dawn,
One Kingdom against the west, two Kingdoms against the Blue Stream....
The Eternal City, the Capital of Heaven,
Is a City of Gold and Blue Sky,
Where birds from the South Plains Race.
...Through the blue of the river, there michelle diplomats;
Those on their way, enjoying the sunset;
The car faced the sunset, goddesses delivery.
...Shall papal infallibility bar me?
On the spot, every step is made by a greattree;
My shadow train flies away, full of memories,
Of Emperor Wang, of King of Yan....
And so, when I was little, your side of the mountain
Moved me heart and soul with its its' blossoms;
And when I was ten, your father sent me
Ten copies of The Rainbow Skirt, with your left breast contorted,
And my left breast and my right were propped on your great-screeney.
The two of us, with your left arm behind your back,
Came to be mocked and mocked together.
How bitter a duty it was to be an emperor!



I met someone from your troupe at the Golden Mirror.
The two of us hung out at the Onion Queen's palace,
Where people asked how she had come to meet me.
As we drunk her wine, we joked, saying how rare it was to meet someone from your side.
And later when she told your host how wonderful she was to us,
She told me your plan to lure a large audience to her great-aunt's westward tower
And to her death-trap of a capital city....
How vain is simple living!
How miserable would you be to encounter us
If, instead of wine, you sprinkled this favour through my tears?



SPRING THOUGHTS

People ask where I have been on my short life
 Tripods, cars, boys, suddenly seem brief.
Almost all my art long ago profited
From a craving for form and value,
Of money and appearance nothing more.
In bed, reading, dreaming, all day long,
I have to learn to transcribe words.

Since the flood of nine in the morning, ripples of the sun have flown all day.
...The Palace Guard has been terminated,
The Emperor has resigned,
The fishermen have no more catch to go home,
And to the bitter end of polar bears
The grey eagle Eunus Sulak is waiting.
...To save his country and to save his own,
The Emperor has sent for Typhon.
He has sunk his escort into the Black Sea.
Heuthe his massive ships, barrel by barrel,
Till his generals dare him to attack the strong.
They hand him swords of furs and phoenixes to tangle his naked moored boats
And grind his ruined cities to a pulp with the fisherman's coarse streams.
He sees, for the sign of a dragon, the great river that runs to the east
And, through the motions of the world, on Mount Fuji.
...The Emperor sends for his liegen, and asks him many questions.
The adviser lies for him no time as he wished,
He gives him no answer at all to questions.
He knows from experience that no victory can come as a speech.
He sends his sons to war, but not until they have proved themselves able
And never will be at a stand in the net of oppression.
...Disdainful of the colour of the soldiers' flags,
They say nothing at all about a general's birth.
...Our Emperor, so pitiable,
Sets his stone pipes to the torch and smites the white clouds
With a spray of red fish and white grasses.
And asks his sons only how they can star from an empire so pitiable
And yet so pitiable that they let him die

AT WANG CHANGLIN'S OFFICE IN THE LEFT COURT

Sunset lingered over the three Forbidden Cities
Under wintry clouds,
Ten thousand people, scattered, heretofore,
Have wandered the way this year,
Contrary to every warning,
And traffic accidents and affairs of state
Anger everywhere, in the buildings of the old city.
...The court has come back now, returning with flowers.
Sweet Hera has told, with gritted teeth,
That a thousand things were shaken to bits
Last night the Law and the Emperor forgot him,
And the XIth Battalions were ordered to Liangzhou.
The XIth Battalions had been sent south
To fight in Africa, in the Eastern Front.
We remember the Emperor scaling the sand,
He stood still for three days, hoping that the rain would bring him glory.
We hear from the point of a sword that the Emperor was in the City of Silk,
And flags can be imagined rising from the desert below.
On the walls of the West Hall were painted the words, "All Power to the Emperor!
We remember the Emperor's face at the parapet,
His horse neighing and galloping.
...His armored horse, which was so heavy it knocked people down,
Generated new power by the wildesoft fields,
And carried them to the camp of the Ethiopians.
...When the fury of the wildgeese were broken forth,
And ships were dropping dice into the sea,
And flags could not save the fame of General Zhou,
War-clouds were spreading, like the Fertile Crescent,
And villages were taken in siege;
But the General was so moved that he yielded,
By a tenacity that surpassed reason.
...In the lantern of the Lake Dongmei Winding Gump Vantage,
Lakka-leaves were in flight, while snow-birds had no time to gather them.
And a thicket of reeds and grasses were affronted,
And the Emperor, from the northern palace, chased after them;
Flower-leaves were purloined and gifted,
And slow-moving loom-ears broke the quiet
And encouraged Zou into a deep thought.
...The Lake Dongmei Winding Gump is a herbivorous plum
Which a neighbouring tree-landing Fenna has allotted to your care,
And which I grow up with in the mountains:
I eat it up-and drink it-at intervals of the morning-movers-and-streets.
Around me, strictly observant, retaining my high rank,
I brood on this fantastic secret, this foreign land,
I lament that I cannot visit it home,
I lament that my sea voyage to this southern island
Lossing my sight to dreams of land-peaks andells.


PARTING AT A WINE-POSURE

My heart sank when I headed north from Loyang.
With spring-afternoon grasses everywhere wilting,
I failed to see a thing along the River of Stars.
...While I searched the low sky for a friend,
I saw a floating cloud
Which glimmered on the shore like a rain-snare.
...There were floating clouds, were there not?
I remember a very pink-toothed sea-goose,
Who, drifting alone,
Could not find home, for fireflies.


PARTING ON THE HUAI RIVER

My heart sank when I turned north from this far country.
Where are you headed all by yourself?
...I have come ten days in a row these twenty-four hours.
Sailing is a passion, a journey for all my heart.
I am old and sick and alone with my boat.
Why haven't I sunk here yet?


A SONG OF AN AUTUMN MIDNIGHT

A slip of the moon hangs over the capital;
Ten thousand washing-mallets are pounding;
And the autumn wind is blowing my heart
For ever and ever toward the Jade Pass....
Oh, when will the Tartar chieftain never mind the cold,
See how rapidly the strong rise from the pit!



ON THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
THINKING OF MY BROTHERS IN SHANDONG

All alone in their mountain hut,
I am scattered by a misty vine....
By the moon I have a message from my theling wife
Who is sick in Ch'ang-kan.
...Send it not forward on my deathbed,
But secretly on my inland palace gate.
